OpenNebula supports a wide range of extensions that enhance and integrate with the core platform. Some of these are developed and maintained by OpenNebula Systems, and are distributed exclusively as part of the Enterprise Edition (marked as **EE**) for customers with an active subscription. Others may be developed, self-certified, and maintained by technology partners, and are distributed under separate commercial or open-source licenses, depending on the provider and use case (marked as **TP** for Third-Party).
