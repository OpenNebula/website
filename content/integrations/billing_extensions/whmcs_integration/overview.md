<!--# Overview -->

**WHMCS** is a web Host billing automation platform which can be configured for many uses.  We provide a module for WHMCS which allows you to automate the creation and management of users, groups, and their Access Control Lists in OpenNebula, as well as providing billing based on their usage metrics.

You will be able to define these resource packages to control the usage and cost of your OpenNebula resources.

When an order is accepted in OpenNebula, the setup is performed: a user and a group are created for the service.  This group will then be assigned a Usage Quota which you will define during the package configuration.

## How I Should Read This Chaper

Before reading this Chapter you should be aware of the [WHMCS Documentation](https://docs.whmcs.com/Documentation_Home) and have it installed on a server which can access your OpenNebula install.  You should also be familiar with OpenNebulaâ€™s [Manage Users]({{% relref "../../../product/cloud_system_administration/multitenancy//manage_users#manage-users" %}}), [Manage Groups]({{% relref "../../../product/cloud_system_administration/multitenancy/manage_groups#manage-groups" %}}), [Usage Quotas]({{% relref "../../../product/cloud_system_administration/capacity_planning/quotas#quota-auth" %}}), and [Managing Permissions]({{% relref "../../../product/cloud_system_administration/multitenancy/chmod#chmod" %}}) features.

In this Chapter there are three guides for this module:
: * Install/Configure
  * Admin Usage
