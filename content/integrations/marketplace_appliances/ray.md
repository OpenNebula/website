## Appliance Description

[Ray](https://www.ray.io/) is an open-source framework for distributed computing and machine learning workloads. The [Ray Appliance](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki/ray_intro) leveragles Ray's **Serve** to enable efficient deployment of inference APIs, and includes the [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) for fast inference and serving.


## Main Features

The Ray appliance includes two frameworks for running LLMs:

- [Hugging Face - Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), one of the most widely adopted frameworks for deploying large language models
- vLLM, the open-source high-perfomance engine for serving large language models with low latency and high throughput
- Configurable deployment options and behavior, controlled by contextualization parameters
