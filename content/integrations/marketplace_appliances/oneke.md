<!--# OpenNebula Kubernetes Engine (OneKE) -->

OneKE is a minimal [hyperconverged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure) Kubernetes platform that comes with OpenNebula out of the box. OneKE is based on [RKE2 - Rancherâ€™s Next Generation Kubernetes Distribution](https://docs.rke2.io/) with preinstalled components to handle:

* storage persistence,
* ingress traffic,
* load balancing.

The full documentation of the [OneKE appliance](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki) is maintained in the OpenNebula Apps project.
