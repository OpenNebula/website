<!--# Virtual Network Functions (VNF) and Virtual Router -->

## Appliance Description

The Virtual Router (VR) is a solution to common problems regarding management of VNETs and routing. It consists of the **Service Virtual Router**, which is deployed as a set of Virtual Machines, and associated logic implemented in the core of OpenNebula.

## Main Features

The VR includes a comprehensive set of features:

- Keepalive Failover, High-Availability for the Service Virtual Router itself
- Router4, for fine control of routing between your Virtual Networks
- NAT4 to enable private Virtual Networks to reach the Internet
- HAProxy Load Balancer, a robust layer4 (TCP) reverse-proxy/load-balancing solution
- Keepalive LVS Load Balancer, so called layer4 switching, a high-performance load-balancing solution
- SDNAT4, a public-to-private, private-to-public IP address mapping (SNAT + DNAT)
- DNS, a DNS recursor (to provide DNS to isolated Virtual Networks)
- DHCP4, an additional DHCP server implementation
