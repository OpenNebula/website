## Appliance Description

The appliance offers a fully preconfigured environment with [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/)
and the [Turtles](https://turtles.docs.rancher.com/turtles/stable) extension installed and integrated.
It ensures seamless recognition of OpenNebula as an infrastructure provider through the
[Cluster API implementation for OpenNebula](https://github.com/OpenNebula/cluster-api-provider-opennebula) (CAPONE).

With this setup, users can easily create, manage, and upgrade OpenNebula CAPI [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/)
clusters from the Rancher UI, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

The full documentation of the [Rancher CAPI appliance](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki/capi_intro)
is maintained in the OpenNebula Apps project.
