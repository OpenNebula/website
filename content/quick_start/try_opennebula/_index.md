<!--# Try OpenNebula with miniONE -->

The tutorials in this section leverage OpenNebula's installation tool, [miniONE](https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione). The tutorials begin with installing the basic OpenNebula component -- the Front-end -- on your choice of installation type. Once the Front-end is installed, you can quickly install more complex cloud infrastructure, using OpenNebula's web UI, [Sunstone]({{% relref "graphical_user_interface" %}}).
