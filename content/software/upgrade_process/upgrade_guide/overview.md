<!--# Overview -->

Keeping your OpenNebula up-to-date is very important, as you will receive the latest functionality and, more importantly, the latest security patches. It is possible to upgrade to the latest OpenNebula release from earlier versions.

## Hypervisor Compatibility

The upgrade procedure can be followed regardless of the hypervisor.

## How Should I Read This Chapter

You only need to read this chapter if you are upgrading OpenNebula to a newer release. Make sure you have read the [Release Notes]({{% relref "../../release_information/release_notes_70" %}}) and particularly the [Compatibility]({{% relref "../../release_information/release_notes_70/compatibility#compatibility" %}}) section first.

The first stop is the [Start Here]({{% relref "start_here#start-here" %}}) section that lays out the workflow needed to upgrade. The system will upgrade from the currently installed release to the latest release. If you need to upgrade from a version older than 6.0, please read [Upgrade from Previous Versions]({{% relref "upgrade_from_previous_versions#upgrade-from-previous" %}}). In case something goes awry you can always [restore OpenNebula]({{% relref "restoring_version#restoring-version" %}}) to the state previous to the update.

After the upgrade procedure you can continue using your upgraded OpenNebula Cloud.
