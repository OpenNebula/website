<!-- The table in this document is generated automatically using a Hugo shortcode from a 
CSV file: /assets/tables/config_files.csv. A helper script /scripts/compare_config_files.py
exists to compare the contents of the CSV with the config files of an OpenNebula installation
for audit purposes.  -->

The following table describes all configuration files and their type from the following directories:

- `/etc/one/`
- `/var/lib/one/remotes/`

These files can be managed using the `onecfg` tool, refer to the [onecfg documentation]({{% relref "software/upgrade_process/configuration_management_ee/usage/" %}}) for more details:
