<!--# Automatic Deployment -->

These tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for automatically installing OpenNebula using [OneDeploy](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-deploy). OneDeploy is a set of Ansible playbooks that automatically installs a complete, production-ready OpenNebula cloud.

The tutorials contain installation steps for two simple scenarios. The [OneDeploy Wiki](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-deploy/wiki) contains detailed information on other deployment and configuration options.
