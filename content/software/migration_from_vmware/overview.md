<!--# Overview -->

You should be reading this Chapter if you are trying to transition your workloads from VMware to OpenNebula. The OneSwap command-line tool allows you to quickly migrate Virtual Machines and appliances.

## How Should I Read This Chapter

This Chapter covers a comprehensive overview of migrating virtual machines (VMs) from VMware to OpenNebula using the `opennebula-swap` (OneSwap) tool. It details the use of OneSwap for importing VMs and Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) that have been exported from VMware environments, such as vCenter and ESXi. The OneSwap tool is highlighted as a key component in streamlining the migration process, as it automates the creation of necessary VM templates and images within OpenNebula. 

The guides cover various functionalities, including the import of single VMDK disks, the conversion of formats to qcow2, and the injection of context packages and drivers for different guest operating systems. Additionally, the documents provide configuration instructions and command-line examples to facilitate a smooth and efficient transition from a VMware infrastructure to OpenNebula.
