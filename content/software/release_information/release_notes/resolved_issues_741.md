A complete list of solved issues for 7.4.1 are listed in the [project development portal](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/milestone/94).

## Backported Issues

The following new features have been backported to 7.4.1:

<!-- item structure
Include a high level description and a link to the documentation explaining the new feature. Example:

* Add per-VM live migration options through [`MIGRATE_AUTO_CONVERGE` and `MIGRATE_COMPRESSED`]({{% relref "/product/operation_references/configuration_references/template#template-features" %}}) VM template attributes. Administrators can now tune auto-convergence and memory compression only for selected KVM VMs, improving migration reliability and bandwidth usage without changing global driver defaults.
-->

* **Virtual Machine Command Execution** — An optional [Exec tab]({{% relref "product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/vm_instances.md#executing-a-command-from-sunstone" %}}) lets users run, monitor, retry, and cancel commands inside Virtual Machines and copy their output directly from Sunstone.
