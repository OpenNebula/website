<!--# What’s New in 7.0 -->

We’re excited to introduce OpenNebula 7.0.0 *Phoenix*, the new major OpenNebula release.

The name *Phoenix* reflects a broader transformation in cloud infrastructure—symbolizing resilience and rebirth for organizations rethinking their architecture in the face of AI, multi-cloud, and edge computing trends.

OpenNebula 7.0.0 represents a major leap forward, especially for those migrating from VMware or modernizing their stack for next-generation workloads. We invite you to explore the features, join the community conversations, and give your feedback on this final release.

We encourage you to review the [Known Issues]({{% relref "known_issues" %}}) and report any bugs through our [GitHub development portal](https://github.com/OpenNebula/).

## OpenNebula Core

- The ability to import wild VMs into OpenNebula has been removed from code to provide a more coherent management experience across all interfaces and APIs.
- Added option [CONTEXT_ALLOW_ETH_UPDATES to oned.conf](../../../product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/oned) to enable updates of VM context `ETH*` values.
- The `enforce` parameter has been restored for the `resize` operation. In this context, it only manages capacity enforcement checks (memory and CPU), while the NUMA topology is always verified independently.
- [Cluster-level quotas](../../../product/cloud_system_administration/capacity_planning/quotas/#compute-quotas), define per-user or per-group resource limits across clusters—especially useful in distributed edge environments. Allow setting per-user or per-group resource limits at the cluster level, enabling precise control over resource consumption across different locations—particularly valuable in distributed edge deployments.
- [Generic quota definitions](../../../product/cloud_system_administration/capacity_planning/quotas/#compute-quotas), track and control usage of custom resources such as vGPUs, licenses, or any administrator-defined metrics.
- [Improve database search queries and performance](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5861)


## Monitoring

- [Resource Usage Forecast](../../../product/cloud_system_administration/resource_monitoring/forecast/): Introduces predictive analytics for Host and VM resource consumption, enabling proactive infrastructure management. By analyzing trends in CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, OpenNebula 7.0 supports improved capacity planning, optimized workload scheduling, and early detection of performance bottlenecks.

## Scheduler

- OpenNebula 7.0.0 features a [complete re-write of the scheduling framework](../../../product/cloud_system_administration/scheduler/overview/#opennebula-scheduler-framework-architecture) to easily support multiple scheduling algorithms, and more responsive and reliable execution of scheduling plans.
- [Intelligent DRS](../../../product/cloud_system_administration/scheduler/drs), a full-featured alternative to VMware DRS, including predictive scheduling, customizable policies, and automated VM migrations.

## Storage & Backups

- [Integrated NFS life cycle setup](../../../product/cluster_configuration/storage_system/nas_ds.md#automatic-nfs-setup): simplify the configuration and management of SAN/NFS in shared storage scenarios.
- [Local datastore enhancements](../../../product/cluster_configuration/storage_system/local_ds): streamlined operations for qcow2-based VM disks, featuring a complete backend rewrite for improved maintainability and performance.
- [LVM backend improvements](../../../product/cluster_configuration/storage_system/lvm_drivers/#lvm-thin): introduces support for snapshots, full backups, and various performance optimizations. These enhancements leverage LVM Thin and provide significant improvements over the original LVM-based management.
- [NetApp iSCSI driver](../../../integrations/storage_extensions/netapp): leverages NetApp’s native API for LUN management to deliver maximum performance and optimize operations for VM disks management.
- [Veeam integration](../../../integrations/backup_extensions/veeam/): allows policy-based backup and restore operations directly for OpenNebula-managed VMs through the Veeam console.
- [Full backup support for LVM](../../../product/cluster_configuration/backup_system/overview): adds native data protection options for traditional environments. Enables full backups using native LVM mechanisms. Incremental backup support is planned for a future release to further enhance backup efficiency.

## Sunstone

- Dynamic Tabs to be able to add third party section in Sunstone in an easy way. Learn how in the [Sunstone Development](../../../software/installation_process/build_from_source_code/sunstone_dev.md#sunstone-dev") guide.
- Guacamole VDI over SSH tunnel, described in the [Remote connections guide](../../../product/control_plane_configuration/graphical_user_interface/fireedge_sunstone.md#fireedge-remote-connections).
- Redesigned part of the Sunstone UI, featuring improved accessibility, streamlined navigation, and new data visualization options.
- New cloud view for end users: a dashboard with real-time metrics and quick access to common actions.
- Support for VM Template Profiles with pre-defined deployment settings.
- Add support for labels in Sunstone, including the labels that were set in the old Sunstone UI. See the [Compatibility guide](../compatibility#compatibility-guide-labels).
- New way to render and group user inputs when instantiating an appliance. Check [User Inputs in Sunstone](product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machine_definitions/vm_templates/#vm-guide-user-inputs-sunstone).

## API and CLI

- [The `onedb purge-history` command now removes history records only within the specified `–start`, `–end` range for the `–id`, instead of deleting all records](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/6699).
- The output of `onemarketapp list` list now contains 2 extra columns displaying **HYPERVISOR** and **ARCHITECTURE**.

## KVM & Networking

- [Transparent proxying](../../../product/virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines_networking/tproxy) allows VMs to access external services like OneGate without requiring complex networking setup.
- [ARM architecture support](../../../product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/kvm_driver/#arm64-specifics), including OpenNebula packages and Marketplace appliances for aarch64.
- [OVA import](../../../software/migration_from_vmware/import_ova): a new CLI command, `oneswap`, allows you to ingest VMs in OVA format which were exported directly from VMware vCenter. Stay tuned for Sunstone support!
- Add support for the `SERIAL` disk attribute. This allows you to specify a `SERIAL` value in [Image](../../../product/operation_references/configuration_references/img_template.md) and [VM Templates](../../../product/operation_references/configuration_references/template.md), including support for automatic generation (`auto`).
- Add support for automatic [UEFI firmware selection](../../../product/operation_references/configuration_references/template.md).
- Generate [NUMA-aware PCIe topology](../../../product/cluster_configuration/hosts_and_clusters/numa.md#pci-passthrough) for NUMA pinned virtual machines (``q35`` chipset).


## OpenNebula Flow

- [Oneflow clients include content-type header to make them work with Sinatra 4.0.0](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/6508).
- [Support for defining Virtual Routers as app roles, simplifying multi-tier deployments](../../../product/virtual_machines_operation/multi-vm_workflows/appflow_use_cli/#defining-the-roles-of-a-service).

## Marketplace

- The [public marketplaces](../../../product/apps-marketplace/public_marketplaces/overview#-overview) appliances generate [scheduling requirements](../../../product/cloud_system_administration/scheduler/overview.md#host-requirements) and [OS configurations](../../../product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/kvm_driver#arm64specifics) based on the architecture.
