<!--# ARM64 packages -->

6.10.3-EE and 6.10.0.1-CE releases include ARM64 packages for all supported operating systems.

These ARM packages are being released in beta mode, allowing the community to test them and provide feedback. This initiative aims to extend OpenNebulaâ€™s flexibility by enabling deployment on ARM-based servers (both hypervisors and Front-end nodes), opening new possibilities for lightweight, distributed cloud environments.

For the configuration details about ARM64 please refer to [ARM64 Specifics]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/kvm_driver#arm64specifics" %}}).
