<!--# ARM64 packages -->

Since OpenNebula version 6.10.3-EE and 6.10.0.1-CE releases include ARM64 packages for all supported operating systems. This initiative aims to extend OpenNebulaâ€™s flexibility by enabling deployment on ARM-based servers (both hypervisors and Front-end nodes), opening new possibilities for lightweight, distributed cloud environments.

For the configuration details about ARM64 please refer to [ARM64 Specifics]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/hypervisor_configuration/kvm_driver#arm64specifics" %}}).
