<!--# Sunstone Development -->

OpenNebula FireEdge server provides a **next-generation web-management interface**.

- Sunstone GUI: `<http://<OPENNEBULA-FRONTEND>:2616/fireedge/sunstone>` (automatically redirected from `<http://<OPENNEBULA-FRONTEND>:2616/`)

This second Sunstone incarnation is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) / [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) is used for the styles and layout of the web.

If you want to do development work over Sunstone, you need to install OpenNebula from source. For this, you will need [build dependencies]({{% relref "build_deps#build-deps" %}}), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [nodeJS v12](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.22.12) and [npm v6](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once the environment has been prepared, you need to clone [one repository](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one) and follow the steps [to compile the OpenNebula software]({{% relref "compile#compile" %}}).

Then move to FireEdge directory (`src/fireedge`) and run:

```default
$ npm i         # Install dependencies from package.json
$ npm run       # List the available scripts
$ npm run build # Build all the modules.
$ npm run start # Start the server, by default accessible on http://localhost:2616/fireedge
```

You can read more about this in the [FireEdge configuration guide]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/fireedge.md#fireedge-install-configuration" %}}).

## Architecture

In our latest generation of FireEdge Sunstone, we have done a architectural revamp, moving from our previously Monolithic architecture towards a more modern and streamlined Micro-Frontend-like architecture. This new architecture is based on the latest Module Federation implementation in [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) which allows us to dynamically, and remotely, load different modules in our baseline Sunstone client.

<a id="base-modules"></a>

The Sunstone client has been split up into **8** different base modules:

> * Components.
> * Constants.
> * Containers.
> * Features.
> * Hooks.
> * Models.
> * Providers.
> * Utils.

These modules have been separated in such a way that no hard links exist between them. Any internal cross-module dependencies are handled at runtime by the module federation through its shared dependency scope. This ensures modules can be rebuilt and served separately from each other.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
By default, when a new version is released, all modules are packaged and shipped with the client, and served from the FireEdge server.{{< /alert >}} 

<a id="remotes-config"></a>

## Remotes Configuration

The `remotes-config.json` file, typically located at `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/remotes-config.json`, dictates where different modules are loaded from. At a minimum, the eight [base modules]({{% relref "#base-modules" %}}) must be defined in this file in order for the client to load properly.

The configuration file is structured according to the following schema:

```json
{
    "<ModuleKey>": {
        "name": "<ModuleName>",
        "entry": "<ModuleEntryURL>"
    },
}
```

Where:
: * `<ModuleKey>` : A unique identifier for the module. Typically matches `name` but serves as the configuration key.
  * `name` : The runtime namespace exposed by the module. Must match the `name` configured in the remote module’s Webpack configuration file.
  * `entry` : The URL to the module’s `remoteEntry.js` file.

### Notes:

- Each module’s `entry` must point to a valid and accessible `remoteEntry.js` file.
- The `name` property must match the runtime namespace as defined in the remote module’s Webpack configuration.
- The `<ModuleKey>` and `name` can be identical but are defined separately to allow flexibility in naming conventions.

{{< alert title="Tip" color="info" >}}
The `__HOST__` flag can be used to simplify setups, as this resolves to the current navigator URL in the client. This should be used most of the time when the remote modules are being served directly from the FireEdge server.{{< /alert >}} 

This example shows the default configuration of the different modules when they are being loaded locally from the FireEdge server.

```json
{
  "UtilsModule": {
    "name": "UtilsModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/UtilsModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "ConstantsModule": {
    "name": "ConstantsModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/ConstantsModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "ContainersModule": {
    "name": "ContainersModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/ContainersModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "ComponentsModule": {
    "name": "ComponentsModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/ComponentsModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "FeaturesModule": {
    "name": "FeaturesModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/FeaturesModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "ProvidersModule": {
    "name": "ProvidersModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/ProvidersModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "ModelsModule": {
    "name": "ModelsModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/ModelsModule/remoteEntry.js"
  },
  "HooksModule": {
    "name": "HooksModule",
    "entry": "__HOST__/fireedge/modules/HooksModule/remoteEntry.js"
  }
}
```

{{< alert title="Hint" color="info" >}}
Loading modules over HTTPS is fully supported and requires no extra setting up in the client.{{< /alert >}} 

### A module fails to load

In the case that a module fails to load, either due to a failed network request or due to a error in the code itself, the fallback editor will be employed. The client checks all modules when loading to make sure that they are properly initialized, in order to try and prevent and narrow down any fatal problems as early on as possible. The fallback editor allows the user to try and repair any misconfigured remotes directly in the browser.

The server passes the `remotes-config.json` file to the client through the [Window Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window), accessible through `window.__REMOTES_MODULE_CONFIG__` from the browser console. This configuration gets potentially modified by the fallback editor and cached using the browser's [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). This cache is implemented in order for the client to be able to use a temporary configuration that persists across reloads in order to mitigate potential lockouts from the user interface.

![image_fallback_editor](/images/fireedge_fallback_editor.png)

Inside the fallback editor, you will have access to a simple interface consisting of a text area for editing the configured remotes (changes do not affect any file on-disk) and three different buttons.

Where:
: * `Reset` : Resets the entire configuration to the minimal eight [base modules]({{% relref "#base-modules" %}}).
  * `Clear fallback configuration` : Clears the fallback flag, discarding any modifications made to the `remotes-config.json` file loaded from the server and attempts to re-use it.
  * `Continue` : Attempts to continue loading the currently defined configuration.

## Tab Manifest

The `tab-manifest.json` file, typically located at `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/tab-manifest.json`, controls the loading of components and is the key to dynamic tab management. This file allows you to dynamically specify new endpoints and how different modules are loaded at those endpoints.

The configuration file is structured according to the following schema:

```json
{
    "title": "<TabTitle>",
    "path": "<TabPath>",
    "sidebar": "<ShowInSidebar>",
    "icon": "<IconName>",
    "moduleId": "<ModuleIdentifier>",
    "Component": "<ComponentName>"
}
```

Where:
: * `title`: The display name of the tab as shown in the UI.
  * `path`: The URL path that maps to this tab. It must be unique across all tabs.
  * `sidebar`:  A boolean (true or false) indicates whether the tab should appear in the sidebar navigation.
  * `icon`: The name of the icon to represent the tab visually. Must correspond to a valid icon identifier from the [iconoir-react library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconoir-react).
  * `moduleId`: The identifier for the remote module. It must match the name field in the corresponding module’s entry in the `remotes-config.json`.
  * `Component`: The exported name of the component that renders the tab’s content.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The client searches for the `Component` from the base of the `<ModuleIdentifier>` and does not support nested imports. All modules should expose their exports through a global barrel file, see [Module webpack configuration]({{% relref "#exporting-remote-modules" %}}) for more details.{{< /alert >}} 

### Adding a new tab

In order to develop a new tab, you need to make sure it has the correct webpack configuration and has been added to the `tab-manifest.json` & `remotes-config.json` files. In this example we will use the [OpenNebula ONE repo](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one) to create a new module and add it to the Sunstone client.

1. Begin by cloning the [one repo](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one)

   ```default
   git clone git@github.com:OpenNebula/one.git
   # Cd into the fireedge directory
   cd ./one/src/fireedge
   ```
2. Build the [base modules]({{% relref "#base-modules" %}}) then start the FireEdge server

   ```default
   $ npm i         # Install dependencies from package.json
   $ npm run       # List the available scripts
   $ npm run build # Build all the modules.
   $ npm run start # Start the server, by default accessible on http://localhost:2616/fireedge
   ```

Now let's create a new module called `CustomContainersModule`, based off the original `ContainersModule`.

3. We will begin by creating a new `src/modules/customContainers` folder

   ```default
   mkdir -p  src/modules/customContainers
   ```

4. Then we’ll copy the `/Users` directory and webpack configuration file from the original `ContainersModule`

   ```default
   # Copying the Users directory
   cp -r src/modules/containers/Users src/modules/customContainers

   # Copying containers webpack config for reference
   cp src/modules/containers/webpack.config.prod.containers.js src/modules/customContainers/webpack.config.prod.customContainers.js

   # We'll also create a index.js file which will expose our new component
   touch src/modules/customContainers/index.js
   ```

5. Now we need to modify the `webpack.config.prod.customContainers.js` file:

   ```javascript
   // We will update the module name at the top to `CustomContainersModule`
   const moduleName = 'ContainersModule'

   // Make sure your module can import the shared dependency script!
   const sharedDeps = require('../sharedDeps')
   ```

   {{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
   We can now save this file as this is really the only modification we need to make, assuming we don’t want to add any new dependencies to the shared context scope, which is defined in `src/modules/sharedDeps.js` if you want to have a look.

   The `sharedDeps.js` file imports the `package.json` file in order to parse dependency versions, but these can be overwritten and modified as you see fit.

   ```javascript
   const deps = require('../../package.json').dependencies

   const sharedDeps = ({ eager = false } = {}) => ({
     react: {
       singleton: true,
       eager,
       requiredVersion: deps.react,
     },
     // Add other dependencies here as needed
   })
  
   module.exports = sharedDeps
   ```
   {{< /alert >}}

6. Moving on to the actual code now, we’ll move into the new `customContainers` directory and modify the `Users.js` file.

   For this example, we’ll modify the normal Users component to also display groups in a column like layout
   ```javascript
   import { Chip, Stack, Typography, Grid } from '@mui/material' // Adding the Grid import

   import {
     Tr,
     MultipleTags,
     ResourcesBackButton,
     GroupsTable, // Adding the GroupsTable import
     UsersTable,
     UserTabs,
     SubmitButton,
     TranslateProvider,
   } from '@ComponentsModule'
   ```

   {{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
   Notice how we import from the `@ComponentsModule` instead of using a relative path to the `src/modules/components` directory. This is because the import goes through the module federation and is resolved dynamically at runtime, as opposed to being bundled within our new module directly.{{< /alert >}} 

   {{< alert title="Important" color="success" >}}
   Cross-module imports should *NEVER* be done relative to one another, only inside subdirectories of the module itself should you use relative import paths like `import ... from @modules/<moduleName>`. See [importing from other modules]({{% relref "#importing-remote-modules" %}}) for more information.{{< /alert >}} 

7. Now let's rename our component to “UsersAndGroups” and modify the code so that we return a two column grid with both our tables inside

   ```jsx
   export function UsersAndGroups() {
     const [selectedRows, setSelectedRows] = useState(() => [])
     const actions = UsersTable.Actions()
     const { zone } = useGeneral()

     return (
       <TranslateProvider>
         <ResourcesBackButton
           selectedRows={selectedRows}
           setSelectedRows={setSelectedRows}
           useUpdateMutation={UserAPI.useUpdateUserMutation}
           zone={zone}
           actions={actions}
           table={(props) => (
             <Grid container spacing={2}>
               <Grid item sm={6}>
                 <UsersTable.Table
                   onSelectedRowsChange={props.setSelectedRows}
                   globalActions={props.actions}
                   onRowClick={props.resourcesBackButtonClick}
                   useUpdateMutation={props.useUpdateMutation}
                   zoneId={props.zone}
                   initialState={{
                     selectedRowIds: props.selectedRowsTable,
                   }}
                 />
               </Grid>

               <Grid item sm={6}>
                 <GroupsTable.Table
                   onSelectedRowsChange={props.setSelectedRows}
                   globalActions={props.actions}
                   onRowClick={props.resourcesBackButtonClick}
                   useUpdateMutation={props.useUpdateMutation}
                   zoneId={props.zone}
                   initialState={{
                     selectedRowIds: props.selectedRowsTable,
                   }}
                 />
               </Grid>
             </Grid>
           )}
           simpleGroupsTags={(props) => (
             <GroupedTags
               tags={props.selectedRows}
               handleElement={props.handleElement}
               onDelete={props.handleUnselectRow}
             />
           )}
           info={(props) => {
             const propsInfo = {
               user: props?.selectedRows?.[0]?.original,
               selectedRows: props?.selectedRows,
             }
             props?.gotoPage && (propsInfo.gotoPage = props.gotoPage)
             props?.unselect && (propsInfo.unselect = props.unselect)

             return <InfoTabs {...propsInfo} />
           }}
         />
       </TranslateProvider>
     )
   }
   ```

8. Now that we have saved our modified `Users.js` file, we need to make sure we are exporting it properly inside our `index.js` file (`src/modules/customContainers/index.js`)

   ```javascript
   export * from '@modules/customContainers/Users'
   ```

   Also, we should update the exports inside the `src/modules/customContainers/Users/index.js` file, as it will point to the wrong directory otherwise
  
   ```javascript
   export * from '@modules/customContainers/Users/Users'
   ```

   {{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
   Here the `@modules` name is an alias we use in our webpack configuration, which gets resolved to the `src/modules` directory when building. You can examine this more closely inside the `webpack.config.prod.customcontainer.js` file. In this case, exporting relative to our parent directory is fine as we are not doing any cross-module referencing. See the [module webpack configuration]({{% relref "#module-webpack-configuration" %}}) section for more information.{{< /alert >}} 

9. Time to build our module (for the sake of convenience we will save the build command inside our `package.json` file)

   ```javascript
   "scripts": {
     "build:ctm": "rimraf dist/modules/ContainersModule && BUILD_TARGET=remote webpack --config ./src/modules/containers/webpack.config.prod.containers.js",

     // Adding it under the alias "build:ccm"
     "build:ccm": "rimraf dist/modules/CustomContainersModule && BUILD_TARGET=remote webpack --config ./src/modules/customContainers/webpack.config.prod.customContainers.js",
     // More module build commands
     }
   ```

   Running the build command

   ```default
   npm run build:ccm # Building our customContainersModule
   > FireEdge@1.0.0 build:ccm
   > rimraf dist/modules/CustomContainersModule && BUILD_TARGET=remote webpack --config ./src/modules/customContainers/webpack.config.prod.customContainers.js

   ```

10. Now we need to copy our new module to the `/usr/lib/one/fireedge/dist/modules` directory, as we will be serving it locally

   ```default
   cp -r dist/modules/CustomContainersModule /usr/lib/one/fireedge/dist/modules
   ```

   This ensures the fireedge server has access to and can serve the module for the client

11. Now we need to add our module to the `remotes-config.yaml` file

   ```yaml
  ContainersModule:
     name: ContainersModule
     entry: __HOST__/fireedge/modules/ContainersModule/remoteEntry.js
  CustomContainersModule:
     name: CustomContainersModule
     entry: __HOST__/fireedge/modules/CustomContainersModule/remoteEntry.js
   ```

   Now the client will fetch and load the `CustomContainersModule`

12. Then we need to update out `tab-manifest.yaml` file with our new `UsersAndGroups` component

   ```yaml
   - title: System
     icon: Home
     routes:
       - title: Create User
         path: /user/create
         Component: CreateUser
       - title: Users and Groups
         path: /usersgroups
         sidebar: true
         icon: User
         moduleId: "CustomContainersModule" # We explicitly define which module to load the component from
         Component: "UsersAndGroups"
   ```

   {{< alert title="Important" color="success" >}}
   Make sure to add the `moduleId` pointing to the “CustomContainersModule”, as otherwise the client will attempt to load the Component from the default `ContainersModule`{{< /alert >}} 

13. Finally we need to add a new [view configuration]({{% relref "../../../product/control_plane_configuration/graphical_user_interface/fireedge_sunstone.md#fireedge-sunstone-views" %}}), allowing us to access the /usersgroups endpoint

   We will do this for the oneadmin user only

   ```default
   cp /etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/admin/user-tab.yaml /etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/admin/usersgroups-tab.yaml
   ```

   And then we update the resource name inside the new `usersandgroups-tab.yaml` view file to match the path of our component

   ```yaml
   resource_name: "USERSGROUPS"
   ```

Now open up your Sunstone web UI (should be reachable at `http://localhost:2616/fireedge`) and you should have a new tab under the “System” category named “Users and Groups”. This displays both the users and groups table next to each other!

![users_and_groups_tab](/images/users_and_groups_tab.png)

Note that all of this was done with the FireEdge Sunstone server up and running in production mode, as the new modularized architecture does not require us to rebuild the client nor the server in order to bring in new changes.

## Module Webpack Configuration

When defining a new module, you need to make sure that it has a correctly defined webpack configuration file. This configuration file can be tweaked as you see fit but should include a few key options in order to be compatible with the Sunstone client.

<a id="default-module-webpack"></a>

This example shows the default webpack configuration file for a module:

```javascript
const moduleName = '<ModuleName>' // This is how the module will be referenced
const path = require('path')
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container
const sharedDeps = require('../sharedDeps') // Dependencies shared between modules
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin')
const ExternalRemotesPlugin = require('external-remotes-plugin')
const ONE_LOCATION = process.env.ONE_LOCATION
const ETC_LOCATION = ONE_LOCATION ? `${ONE_LOCATION}/etc` : '/etc'

// The path to the remotes-config.json file, necessary in order to resolve cross-module dependencies when building.
const remotesConfigPath =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? `${ETC_LOCATION}/one/fireedge/sunstone/remotes-config.json`
    : path.resolve(
        __dirname,
        '..',
        '..',
        '..',
        'etc',
        'sunstone',
        'remotes-config.json'
      )

const remotesConfig = require(remotesConfigPath)

const configuredRemotes = Object.entries(remotesConfig)
  .filter(([_, { name }]) => name !== moduleName)
  .reduce((acc, [module, { name }]) => {
    acc[
      `@${module}`
    ] = `${name}@[window.__REMOTES_MODULE_CONFIG__.${module}.entry]`

    return acc
  }, {})

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'index.js'),
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../', 'dist', 'modules', moduleName),
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
    chunkFilename: '[contenthash].[id].js',
    uniqueName: moduleName,
    publicPath: 'auto',
  },
  plugins: [

When creating a new module you can use [this]({{% relref "#default-module-webpack" %}}) template as a base. Just make sure you update the `<ModuleName>` to match the name of your module.

<a id="resolving-remote-modules"></a>

### Resolving other modules

Make sure you have added all your modules to the correct [remotes-config.json]({{% relref "#remotes-config" %}}) file, as this file will be imported during builds to help resolve remote module imports.

```javascript
// The path to the remotes-config.json file, necessary in order to resolve cross-module dependencies when building.
const remotesConfigPath =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? `${ETC_LOCATION}/one/fireedge/sunstone/remotes-config.json`
    : path.resolve(
        __dirname,
        '..',
        '..',
        '..',
        'etc',
        'sunstone',
        'remotes-config.json'
      )

const remotesConfig = require(remotesConfigPath)

const configuredRemotes = Object.entries(remotesConfig)
  .filter(([_, { name }]) => name !== moduleName)
  .reduce((acc, [module, { name }]) => {
    acc[
      `@${module}`
    ] = `${name}@[window.__REMOTES_MODULE_CONFIG__.${module}.entry]`

    return acc
  }, {})
```

### Shared module dependencies

When building your modules you should review the shared dependency configuration, which by default is defined in the `src/modules/sharedDeps.js` file. This script imports the `package.json` file for resolving different dependency versions and should be sufficient in most cases.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
Not all dependencies are shared between modules. For more information on which dependencies should be shared and how to configure them, you can refer to the official [Module Federation documentation](https://module-federation.io/configure/shared.html).{{< /alert >}} 

<a id="importing-remote-modules"></a>

### Importing from other modules

In order to import correctly between modules, you should not use relative import paths between them, even if this may seem convenient at first, because this creates a hard link between the modules and webpack will bundle parts of them together. This in turn means that the modules cannot be rebuilt independently of one another. Instead, you should use the following syntax to import from another module:

`import ... from @<ModuleName>`

This should match the key property in the `configuredRemotes` object, as mentioned previously in the [resolving other modules]({{% relref "#resolving-remote-modules" %}}) section.

<a id="exporting-remote-modules"></a>

### Exporting from a module

All remote module exports should be done using a global barrel file. This means that all nested exports should be accessible from the top-level index file of the module.

{{< alert title="Important" color="success" >}}
Default exports should not be used. You should use named exports only, when exposing imports according to the default webpack configuration used [here]({{% relref "#default-module-webpack" %}}).{{< /alert >}} 

An example of the barrel file from the `ContainersModule`

```javascript
export * from '@modules/containers/ACLs'
export * from '@modules/containers/BackupJobs'
export * from '@modules/containers/Backups'
export * from '@modules/containers/Clusters'
export * from '@modules/containers/Dashboard'
export * from '@modules/containers/Datastores'
export * from '@modules/containers/Files'
export * from '@modules/containers/Groups'
export * from '@modules/containers/Guacamole'
export * from '@modules/containers/Hosts'
export * from '@modules/containers/Images'
export * from '@modules/containers/Login'
export * from '@modules/containers/MarketplaceApps'
export * from '@modules/containers/Marketplaces'
export * from '@modules/containers/Providers'
export * from '@modules/containers/Provisions'
export * from '@modules/containers/SecurityGroups'
export * from '@modules/containers/ServiceTemplates'
export * from '@modules/containers/Services'
export * from '@modules/containers/Settings'
export * from '@modules/containers/Support'
export * from '@modules/containers/TestApi'
export * from '@modules/containers/TestForm'
export * from '@modules/containers/Users'
export * from '@modules/containers/VDCs'
export * from '@modules/containers/VnTemplates'
export * from '@modules/containers/VirtualMachines'
export * from '@modules/containers/VirtualNetworks'
export * from '@modules/containers/VirtualRouterTemplates'
export * from '@modules/containers/VirtualRouters'
export * from '@modules/containers/VmGroups'
export * from '@modules/containers/VmTemplates'
export * from '@modules/containers/WebMKS'
export * from '@modules/containers/Zones'
```

These exports are then being exposed directly from the module namespace. See the exposes section under the [default module webpack]({{% relref "#default-module-webpack" %}}) configuration.

## FireEdge API

OpenNebula FireEdge API is a RESTful service to communicate with other OpenNebula services.

Among others, it includes the OpenNebula Cloud API Specification for JS. It been designed as a wrapper for the [XML-RPC methods]({{% relref "../../../product/integration_references/system_interfaces/api.md#api" %}}), with some basic helpers to return the data in JSON formats. This means that you should be familiar with the XML-RPC API and the JSON formats returned by the OpenNebula core.

### Authentication & Authorization

User authentication is done via XMLRPC using the OpenNebula authorization module. If the username and password matches with the serveradmin data, the user’s request will be granted, the session data will be saved in a global variable (cache-nodejs), and a JSON Web Token (JWT) will be generated that must be sent in the authorization header of the HTTP request.

```default
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
$ -d '{"user": "username", "token": "password"}' \
$ http://fireedge.server/fireedge/api/auth
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The JWT lifetime can be configured in the fireedge_server.conf configuration file.{{< /alert >}}

## Front-end Architecture

An important part of managing OpenNebula through an interface is the use of forms and lists of resources. For this reason, we decided to extract some of this logic in configuration files.

Unlike in the legacy Ruby-based Sunstone, it’s the behavior of requests in parallel which allows the use of the interface with greater flexibility and fluidity.

Queries to get the pool resource from OpenNebula are greatly optimized, which ensures a swift response of the interface. If a large amount of certain types of resources are present (for example VMs or Hosts), a performance strategy that consists of making queries with intervals is implemented. Thus, the representation of the first interval list of resources is faster and the rest of the queries are kept in the background.

## Sunstone Configuration Files

Through the configuration files we can define view types and assign them to different groups. Then, we differentiate between the master and view files.

### Master File

This file orchestrates the views according to the user’s primary group and is located in `etc/sunstone/sunstone-view.yaml`.

In the following example, all groups have access to the user view and `oneadmin` to the admin view also:

```yaml
# etc/sunstone/sunstone-view.yaml
groups:
  oneadmin:
    - admin
    - user
default:
  - user
```

### View Directory And Tab Files

The view directory contains the route or tab files. These tab files, with YAML extension, describe the behavior of each resource list within the application: VMs, Networks, Hosts, etc.

The tab files are located in `etc/sunstone/<view_name>/<resource_tab>`.

## Adding New Tabs

OpenNebula resources are grouped into pools and can be managed from the interface through resource tab (or route), where we can operate over one or more resources, filter by attributes, or get detailed information about individual resources.

To develop a new tab, it’s necessary to understand the structure of the configuration tab files:

- **Resource**: related information about resources.
- **Actions**: buttons to operate over the resources.
- **Filters**: list of criteria to filter the resources.
- **Information Tabs**: list of tabs to show detailed information.
- **Dialogs**: steps and logic to render the dialog.

### Resource

Using the view files as a starting point, the interface generates the available routes and defines them in a menu.

Through each tab in the sidebar you can control and manage OpenNebula resources. All tabs should have a folder in the containers directory `src/client/containers` and have enabled the route in `src/client/apps/sunstone/routesOne.js`.

| Property        | Description                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `resource_name` | Reference to `RESOURCE_NAMES` in `src/client/constants/index.js` |

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
It’s important that `resource_name` matches the `RESOURCE_NAMES` constant because the constants are used to define the routes in `src/client/apps/sunstone/routesOne.js`.{{< /alert >}} 

### Actions

List of actions to operate over the resources: `refresh`, `chown`, `chgrp`, `lock`, `unlock`, etc.

There are three action types:

- Form modal actions: These actions do not have a `_dialog` suffix.
- Actions referenced in other files: For example, the VM Template `create_app_dialog` references the Marketplace App `create_dialog`.
- Form actions on separate route: These actions have a `_dialog` suffix. For example, the VM Template `instantiate_dialog` will have a route defined similar to `http://localhost:2616/fireedge/sunstone/vm-template/instantiate`.

All actions are defined in the resource constants. For example, those of the VM Template are located in `src/client/constants/vmTemplate.js` as `VM_TEMPLATE_ACTIONS`.

### Filter

This includes the list of criteria to filter each OpenNebula resource pool.

To add one, first it’s necessary to implement the filter in the table columns. E.g.:

```javascript
// src/client/components/Tables/MarketplaceApps/columns.js
{
  Header: 'State',
  id: 'STATE',
  disableFilters: false,
  Filter: ({ column }) =>
    CategoryFilter({
      column,
      multiple: true,
      title: 'State',
    }),
  filter: 'includesValue',
}
```

### Information Tabs

The detailed view of a resource is structured in a tab-like layout. Tabs are defined in the `index.js` file of each resource’s folder `src/client/components/Tabs/<resource>`. For example, the VM Templates tabs are located in `src/client/components/Tabs/VmTemplate/index.js`.

Each entry in the `info-tabs` represents a tab and they all have two attributes, except for the `info` tab:

- `enabled`: defines if the tab is visible.
- `actions`: contains the allowed actions in the tab. The utility function to get the available actions for a tab is located at `src/client/models/Helper.js`.

The `info` tab is special because it contains panel sections. Each panel section is an attribute group that can include actions itself.

Attribute groups can be separated into four panels:

- Information: main attributes and details for the resource.
- Permissions: associated permissions for the owner, the users in their group, and others.
- Ownership: user and group to which it belongs.
- Attributes (not always displayed): these panels are separate because they have information about each hypervisor and monitoring.

Each group of actions can filter by hypervisor (**only resources with hypervisor**), e.g.:

```yaml
# etc/sunstone/admin/vm-tab.yaml
storage:
  enabled: true
  actions:
    attach_disk:
      enabled: true
      not_on:
        - lxc
```

### Dialogs

The resource actions that have the `_dialog` suffix need to define their structure in this section.

The first entries in the dialog refer to the available steps. Then, within the individual step definitions are the accessible sections.

Each step and section should match the **id** in the code and can filter by hypervisor (**only resources with hypervisor**).

See some examples:

- Required step: `src/client/components/Forms/VmTemplate/InstantiateForm/Steps/VmTemplatesTable/index.js`
- Step with sections: `src/client/components/Forms/VmTemplate/InstantiateForm/Steps/BasicConfiguration/index.js`
- Step with tabs: `src/client/components/Forms/VmTemplate/InstantiateForm/Steps/AdvancedOptions/index.js`

```yaml
# etc/sunstone/admin/vm-template-tab.yaml
# ** Required means that it's necessary for the operation of the form
dialogs:
  information: true
  ownership: true
  capacity: true
  vm_group: true
  network: true
  storage: true
  placement: true
  sched_action: true
  booting: true
  backup: true
create_dialog:
  ownership: true
  capacity: true
  showback: true
  vm_group: true
  network: true
  storage: true
  placement: true
  pci: true
  input_output: true
  sched_action: true
  context: true
  booting: true
  numa:
    enabled: true
    not_on:
      - lxc
  backup: true
```

### SSO (Single sign-on)

With this function you can access the Sunstone UI from the browser without logging in. For this, you need to send the JWT of the user in the `externalToken` parameter of the URL.

For example:

```default
$ https://{fireedge-sunstone}?externalToken={JWT}
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
To obtain the JWT you must first make a call to `http://{fireedge}/fireedge/api/auth` sending the user’s credentials and retrieving only the value of **token**, e.g.:

```default
 $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 $ -d '{ "user": "username", "token": "password" }' \
 $ http://{fireedge}/fireedge/api/auth

{"id":200,"message":"OK","data":{"token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIwIiwiYXVkIjoic2VydmVyYWRtaW46b25lYWRtaW4iLCJqdGkiOiJ2SU85ME91VUU5b1RNaXRRVytLYmNqRXZlS252Qnc5c2Ura1pPNlVRdmRjPSIsImlhdCI6MTY1MDI3NTQzMC45MzcsImV4cCI6MTY1MDI4NjIzMH0.AqJGLbCNG470PbjoI4yLqvKNOl1FR4Ui6YlK6pSZddQ","id":"0"}}
