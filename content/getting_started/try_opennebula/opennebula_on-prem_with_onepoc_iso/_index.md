title: "OpenNebula On-prem with OnePoC ISO"
description: "For faster evaluations or more controlled Proof-of-Concept (PoC) environments, you can use the OpenNebula PoC ISO. This ready-to-use image allows you to boot into a preconfigured OpenNebula setup without needing to install anything manually. It’s ideal for testing on physical hardware, lab environments, or air-gapped systems, and is especially useful when you want to showcase key features with minimal setup effort"
