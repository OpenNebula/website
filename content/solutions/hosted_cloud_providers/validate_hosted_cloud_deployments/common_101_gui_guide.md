This guide provides the basic steps. If you wish to see a more detailed guide, please refer to [Deploying a Virtual Machine Locally]({{% relref "deploy_opennebula_onprem_with_minione#deploying-a-virtual-machine-locally" %}}).

After successfully verifying the infrastructure deployed by the automations, to run a Virtual Machine access the OpenNebula web UI at:

`http://<Front-end public IP>:2616/fireedge/sunstone`

To log in, use the default username `oneadmin`, and the password specified in the `one_pass` variable of the inventory file.

The image below shows the **Alpine Linux 3.20** Virtual Machine included in the OpenNebula installation:

To test connectivity, from the deployed VM, ping a public IP address, e.g. `8.8.8.8`, as shown below.

Finally, as a cleanup step, terminate the VM by clicking the red “Trash can” icon, then verify that the VM transitions to state `DONE`, as shown below.
