This section contains the specification of the used Ampere hardware and software resources for the reference OpenNebula deployment.

## Architecture

The target high-level cloud architecture overview is shown below. Two Ampere servers are used: the first for hosting the OpenNebula Front-end services and VMs, the second for hosting VMs only. A simple VXLAN networking is configured for the communication between the VMs, so all deployed VMs are attached to the same logical LAN.

## Hardware Specification

The tables below detail the characteristics for the Front-end, virtualization host, storage, networking and provisioning model.

### Front-end Requirements

Two identical servers were used. One of them acts as Front-end and both of them acts as hosts.
