## Basic Configuration

To set up Ceph RBD mirroring between two OpenNebula sites, you will need to configure asynchronous block-level replication of RBD images in order to ensure that Virtual Machine disk images are synchronized.

First, you deploy two independent Ceph clusters, one per site (**Site A** and **Site B**). These clusters must use matching RBD pool names. (In this guide, we will use a pool called `one`). To avoid duplicate image names, Site B does not have any images in the same pool.

On Site A, you need to:

- Set the VM images as **persistent** in the OpenNebula database. This means that modifications you make to each image will be preserved after the VM is terminated. You can set a VM image as persistent when you create the image or later, using the `oneimage` command. For details see [Creating Images]({{% relref "images#creating-images" %}}) and [Changing the Persistent Mode]({{% relref "images#changing-the-persistent-mode" %}}) in the Images documentation.

On Site B, you need to:

- Retrieve the metadata for each VM. You can do this with `onevm show`. For full details on this and other Virtual Machine operations, see [Virtual Machine Instances]({{% relref "vm_instances" %}}).

### Create Ceph Users

To use RBD mirroring, you will need to set up two users for the Ceph clusters: one for the `rbd-mirror` daemon on the source Ceph cluster (Site A) and one for the daemon on the target Ceph cluster (Site B). These users will enable the `rbd-mirror` daemon on each Ceph cluster to authenticate against each other.

This section lists the commands to create the Ceph user on the Ceph clusters for Site and Site B.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
Throughout this guide, `one` is used as the pool name, and `site-a` and `site-b` as the Ceph cluster names.

Unless otherwise specified, all commands in this guide should be run as `root`.
{{< /alert >}}

#### On Site A

To create the user in the source Ceph cluster, run:

```bash
ceph auth get-or-create client.rbd-mirror-peer-a mon 'profile rbd' osd 'profile rbd' -o /etc/ceph/site-a.client.rbd-mirror-peer-a.keyring
```

This creates a secret key for the user and outputs it to the file `/etc/ceph/site-a.client.rbd-mirror-peer-a.keyring`. You will need to copy this file to the Ceph cluster at Site B. To copy the contents to all hosts on Site B, you can run this one-line script, (replacing the node and site names if necessary):

```bash
for host in node{0..3}-site-b; do echo $host; scp /etc/ceph/site-a.client.rbd-mirror-peer-a.keyring root@$host:/etc/ceph/site-a.client.rbd-mirror-peer-a.keyring; done
```

Then, on each host change the ownership of the file to user `ceph`:

```bash
for host in node{0..3}-site-b; do echo $host; ssh $host chown ceph:ceph /etc/ceph/site-a.client.rbd-mirror-peer-a.keyring; done
```
<a id="site-b-user"></a>
#### On Site B

On the target Ceph cluster (Site B), you will need to create a local user for the `rbd-mirror` daemon. Here we will use `$(hostname)` to match the unique ID to that used for other Ceph services such as monitors.

```bash
ceph auth get-or-create client.rbd-mirror.$(hostname) mon 'profile rbd-mirror' osd 'profile rbd' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.rbd-mirror.$(hostname).keyring
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
If you wish to restrict the user permissions to this specific pool, you can use `profile rdb pool=one`:

```bash
ceph auth get-or-create client.rbd-mirror.$(hostname) mon 'profile rbd-mirror' osd 'profile rbd pool=one' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.rbd-mirror.$(hostname).keyring
```
{{< /alert >}}

### Enabling Daemon Access to the "Site A" Ceph Cluster

To enable the `rbd-mirror` daemon on Site B to access the Ceph cluster on Site A, you will need to copy the `ceph.conf` file from Site A to Site B, and name it `site-a.conf`.

On Site A, you can run the command below to copy the file to all nodes on Site B (replacing the node and site names if necessary):

```bash
for host in node{0..3}-site-b; do echo $host; scp /etc/ceph/ceph.conf root@$host:/etc/ceph/site-a.conf; done
root@site-a $ for host in node{0..3}-site-b; do echo $host; ssh $host chown ceph:ceph /etc/ceph/site-a.conf; done
```

Then, to change ownership of the file to system user `ceph`:

```bash
for host in node{0..3}-site-b; do echo $host; ssh $host chown ceph:ceph /etc/ceph/site-a.conf; done
```

Make sure that the name of the config file matches the name used in the keyring that stores the authentication information.

## Enable Mirroring

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
When RBD mirroring is enabled for the entire pool, all newly-created images will inherit the `journal` and `exclusive-lock` attributes. However, only template images that do not need to be synchronized will be automatically synchronized to the opposite site, and VM images will not be synchronized even if they inherit the `journal` and `exclusive-lock` attributes, since that would require _flattening_ the image.

Site A can be configured with mirroring in `image` mode, but Site B always needs to use mirroring in `pool` mode.
{{< /alert >}}

The below commands illustrate how to enable mirroring on the source and target Ceph clusters.

### Enable Mirroring on Site A

On Site A, you can enable mirroring in `pool` or `image` mode. To enable it in `pool` mode, run:

```bash
rbd mirror pool enable one pool
```

If you wish to enable mirroring with `image` mode, skip the above command and follow the steps [below](#enable-mirroring-on-site-a-in-image-mode), then come back to this section to enable mirroring in Site B.

### Enable Mirroring on Site B

On Site B, mirroring must always use `pool` mode. To enable it, run:

```bash
rbd mirror pool enable one pool
```

To verify mirroring:

```bash
rbd mirror pool info one
```

Next, we need to tell the pool on site B which keyring and Ceph config file it should use to connect to the peer (Site A).

```bash
rbd mirror pool peer add one client.rbd-mirror-peer-a@site-a
```

You can check the settings by running:

```bash
rbd mirror pool info one
```

For example:

```default
root@site-b $ rbd mirror pool info one
Mode: pool
Site Name: 16c707cc-a764-47d4-b308-eefa06ff1205
Peer Sites: 
UUID: 164f8358-70a3-4f2d-a727-8729fa186b88
Name: site-a
Mirror UUID: 
Direction: rx-tx
Client: client.rbd-mirror-peer-a
```

The `Direction` field should display `rx-tx` and the client should be set correctly to match the keyring file. The name should also be shown correctly (`site-a`).

### Install the `rbd-mirror` Daemon on Site B

To install the daemon, run:

```bash
apt install rbd-mirror
```

Then, enable and modify the `systemd` unit file for `rbd-mirror`:

```bash
systemctl enable ceph-rbd-mirror.target
```

```bash
cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/ceph-rbd-mirror@.service /etc/systemd/system/ceph-rbd-mirror@.service
```

### Create the Mirroring Service on Site B

Next, you will need to create and start the mirroring service. Ensure to give it the same name as the local user for the Site B cluster created earlier (see [above](#site-b-user)), or the Site A daemon won't be able to authenticate against the Site B cluster.

```bash
systemctl enable --now ceph-rbd-mirror@rbd-mirror.$(hostname).service
```

If we check the status and logs of the `ceph-rbd-mirror@rbd-mirror.<hostname>.service_` service, we should see that it comes up and does not log any authentication errors.

To check service status, run:

```bash
systemctl status ceph-rbd-mirror@rbd-mirror.ubuntu2204-kvm-ceph-squid-6-10-cqyoo-0.service
```

For example:

```default
root@site-b $ systemctl status ceph-rbd-mirror@rbd-mirror.ubuntu2204-kvm-ceph-squid-6-10-cqyoo-0.service
● ceph-rbd-mirror@rbd-mirror.ubuntu2204-kvm-ceph-squid-6-10-cqyoo-0.service - Ceph rbd mirror daemon
 	Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ceph-rbd-mirror@.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
 	Active: active (running) since Mon 2025-06-09 12:04:50 UTC; 6 days ago
   Main PID: 17234 (rbd-mirror)

```

At this point, mirroring should be configured from Site A to Site B, with direction `tx-only`. To verify the mirroring, see below.

### Verify Mirroring

On Site A, run:

```bash
rbd mirror pool info one
```

Output should similar to:

```default
root@site-a $ rbd mirror pool info one
Mode: pool
Site Name: 277ddb4b-1323-425f-bf28-fa8c58c0137e

Peer Sites: 

UUID: 0ab31017-3e80-470d-b80d-1ba04d606b13

Mirror UUID: 5218ea1d-fcb7-404e-82f0-e48a77a05935
Direction: tx-only
```

To obtain detailed information about the mirroring, run:

```bash
rbd mirror pool status one --verbose
```

For example:

```default
root@site-b $ rbd mirror pool status one --verbose
health: OK
daemon health: OK
image health: OK
images: 0 total

DAEMONS

  hostname: ubuntu2204-kvm-ceph-squid-6-10-cqyoo-0
  version: 19.2.2
  leader: true
  health: OK
```
### Enable Mirroring on Site A in `image` mode

If you want to use `image` mode for Site A mirroring, you will need to define which images should be mirrored, and enable the `exclusive-lock` and `journal` features for the images.

To enable journal-based mirroring for an image (in this example, image `one-0-0-0`), run:

```bash
rbd mirror image enable one/one-0-0-0 exclusive-lock,journal
```

Then, verify the image:

```bash
rbd image 'one-0-0-0':
```

For example:

```default
root@site-a $ rbd image 'one-0-0-0':
	size 256 MiB in 64 objects
	order 22 (4 MiB objects)
	snapshot_count: 0
	id: 39b66a80b833
	block_name_prefix: rbd_data.39b66a80b833
	format: 2
	features: layering, exclusive-lock, journaling
	op_features: 
	flags: 
	create_timestamp: Wed Jun  4 10:31:42 2025
	access_timestamp: Mon Jun  9 12:08:11 2025
	modify_timestamp: Mon Jun  9 12:08:05 2025
	parent: one/one-0@snap
	overlap: 256 MiB
	journal: 39b66a80b833
	mirroring state: enabled
	mirroring mode: journal
	mirroring global id: f0523ef9-a784-420f-8725-c3f81ff5a302
	mirroring primary: true
```

Next, since VM disks are just snapshots based on the image, we will need to flatten the required image:

```bash
rbd flatten one/one-0-0-0
```

After performing these steps, to enable mirroring on Site B go back to the section [above](#enable-mirroring-on-site-b).

### Enable Two-way Mirroring for Failback

**Failback** is the process by which Virtual Machines are restored to the primary site, once normal operation on the site has resumed.

To failback Virtual Machines to Site A when it becomes available again after an outage, you will need to set up the `rbd-mirror` daemon on Site A. The daemon will connect to Site B during failback. On Site A, install the `rbd-mirror` daemon and enable the service by following the same steps described above for Site B:

- [Install the `rbd-mirror` daemon](#install-the-rbd-mirror-daemon-on-site-b)
- [Create the mirroring service](#create-the-mirroring-service-on-site-b)
