<!--# Overview -->

This chapter describes the performance capabilities of various OpenNebula components and how to deploy and configure OpenNebula on a large scale or just fine-tune the performance.

## How Should I Read This Chapter

Read the [Scalability Testing and Tuning]({{% relref "scalability#one-scalability" %}}) to understand the performance capabilities of OpenNebula and ways to improve performance by following test scenarios. Move on to the [Sunstone for Large Deployment]({{% relref "fireedge_for_large_deployments#fireedge-advance" %}}) to learn how to achieve a better performance and security by running Sunstone GUI within a web server or behind HTTP(S) proxy. After this, you can get familiar with how OpenNebula deals with SSH and how to streamline the SSH configuration in [Advanced SSH Usage]({{% relref "advanced_ssh_usage#node-ssh" %}}).
