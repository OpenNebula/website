Move on to the [FireEdge for Large Deployments]({{% relref "fireedge_for_large_deployments" %}}) to learn how to achieve a better performance and security by running Sunstone GUI within a web server or behind HTTP(S) proxy. After this, you can get familiar with how OpenNebula deals with SSH and how to streamline the SSH configuration in [Advanced SSH Usage]({{% relref "advanced_ssh_usage" %}}).
