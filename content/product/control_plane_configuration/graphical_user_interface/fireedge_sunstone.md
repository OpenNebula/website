<!--# Using Sunstone -->

## Overview

**Sunstone** is the new generation OpenNebula web interface, fully featured for VM and VM Template management and with other [sections]({{% relref "#fireedge-sections" %}}) ready covering most functionality for end users.

This interface is delivered by the [FireEdge server]({{% relref "../../operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/fireedge#fireedge-setup" %}}), and is its main interface, meaning that it will redirect to Sunstone when contacted in the `http://<OPENNEBULA-FRONTEND>:2616/` address.

## Configuration

To configure Sunstone, there are several options to consider and they are described in the [FireEdge Configuration]({{% relref "../../operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/fireedge#fireedge-setup" %}}) guide.

## Usage

This completely fresh user experience is available by accessing `http://<OPENNEBULA-FRONTEND>:2616`. On the left menu, users can find the available tabs to manage resources, as described in the [Sections]({{% relref "../../operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/fireedge#fireedge-setup" %}}) part of this guide.

Sunstone users can change their current view from the top-right dropdown menu:

## Views

Using the Sunstone views, you can provide a simplified UI aimed at end users of an OpenNebula cloud. Sunstone Views are fully customizable, so you can easily enable or disable specific information tabs or action buttons. [You can define multiple views for different user groups]({{% relref "#fireedge-sunstone-new-view" %}}). Each view defines a set of UI components, so each user accesses and views the relevant parts of the cloud for their role. Default views:

- [Admin View]({{% relref "#fireedge-sunstone-admin-view" %}}).
- [User View]({{% relref "#fireedge-sunstone-user-view" %}}).
- [Groupadmin View]({{% relref "#fireedge-sunstone-groupadmin-view" %}}).
- [Cloud View]({{% relref "#fireedge-sunstone-cloud-view" %}}).

Each view is in an individual directory, `admin`, `user`, `groupadmin`, and `cloud` that OpenNebula proposes by default, as described in the next section.

### Default Views

<a id="fireedge-sunstone-admin-view"></a>

### Admin View

This view provides complete control of the Virtual Machines, Templates, and Marketplace apps. Details can be configured in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/admin/` directory.

![fireedge_sunstone_admin_view](/images/fireedge_sunstone_admin_view.png)

<a id="fireedge-sunstone-user-view"></a>

### User View

Based on the Admin View. It is an advanced user view intended for users with fewer privileges than an admin user, allowing them to manage Virtual Machines and Templates. Users will not be able to manage or retrieve the Hosts and clusters of the cloud. Details can be configured in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/user/` directory.

![fireedge_sunstone_user_view](/images/fireedge_sunstone_user_view.png)

<a id="fireedge-sunstone-groupadmin-view"></a>

### Groupadmin View

This view is like a limited version of the cloud administrator view to be used by the administrators of a group. Details can be configured in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/groupadmin/` directory. More details on [Group admin view]({{% relref "groupadmin_view#group-admin-view" %}})

<a id="fireedge-sunstone-cloud-view"></a>

### Cloud View

This is a simplified view intended for cloud consumers that just require a portal where they can provision new VMs easily. Details can be configured in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/cloud/` directory. More details on [Cloud view]({{% relref "cloud_view#cloud-view" %}})

<a id="fireedge-sunstone-new-view"></a>

### Defining a New View

The views definitions are placed in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views` directory. Each view is defined by a folder (named as the view) with the necessary configuration files inside.

```default
/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views
...
|-- admin/
|   |-- backup-tab.yaml           <--- the Backup tab configuration file
|   |-- cluster-tab.yaml          <--- the Cluster tab configuration file (not installed by default)
|   |-- datastore-tab.yaml        <--- the Datastore tab configuration file
|   |-- file-tab.yaml             <--- the File tab configuration file
|   |-- group-tab.yaml            <--- the Group tab configuration file
|   |-- host-tab.yaml             <--- the Host tab configuration file
|   |-- image-tab.yaml            <--- the Image tab configuration file
|   |-- marketplace-app-tab.yaml  <--- the Marketplace App tab configuration file
|   |-- sec-group-tab.yaml        <--- the Security Group tab configuration file
|   |-- user-tab.yaml             <--- the User tab configuration file
|   |-- vdc-tab.yaml              <--- the VDC tab configuration file
|   |-- vm-tab.yaml               <--- the VM tab configuration file
|   |-- vm-template-tab.yaml      <--- the VM Template tab configuration file
|   |-- vm-group-tab.yaml         <--- the VM Group tab configuration file
|   |-- vnet-tab.yaml             <--- the Virtual Network tab configuration file
|-- sunstone-server.conf
|-- sunstone-views.yaml           <--- the FireEdge Sunstone views main configuration
`-- user/
    ...
    |-- vm-tab.yaml               <--- the VM tab configuration file
    `-- vm-template-tab.yaml      <--- the VM Template tab configuration file
...
```

The easiest way to create a custom view is to copy the `admin` or `user` folder and modify its content as needed. After that, add the new view into `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/sunstone-views.yaml`.

### View Customization

On Sunstone each view is defined by a folder that has the YAML files for the configured tabs. The content for those files is divided into sections that are described in the following sections.

In the following tables, the description field contains the expected behavior when it is set to `true`.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The attributes can be modified only if they come in the YAML file by default. If an attribute is not present, it has the same behavior as when it is set to false.{{< /alert >}}

### Actions

## Remote connections

### OpenNebula VNC remote connection.

Sunstone allows direct connections to VMs using VNC. It admits parameters such as configuring the Host and port for remote connections, configuring the keyboard layout (needed for qemu KVM Hosts), and setting a connection password.

To set these VNC connection configurations we must:

1. Go to the VM template configuration and click on create or update an existing one.
2. Go to the “Advanced options” step and click on Input/Output.
3. Under the “Graphics” section there are all the VNC configurations.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
In case the VNC client is blurry or has any kind of visual tearing, try switching to the **virtio** video device type instead. This can be done by selecting the VM and going to the `Configuration` tab.
![fireedge_sunstone_update_vm_config](/images/sunstone_update_vm_config.png)
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
Due to hypervisor limitations it is not possible to share the clipboard with the VM. For this we recommend the use of RDP or SSH.{{< /alert >}}

![fireedge_sunstone_vnc](/images/sunstone-vnc.png)

### Actions in VNC console

At the top of the console you can find the buttons for the following actions:

- **Full Screen**: Set the console to full screen mode.
- **Screenshot**: Take a screenshot from the VNC console.
- **Reconnect**: Reconnect the VNC console.
- **Lock/Unlock**: Lock/Unlock the use of the keyboard and mouse.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
Sunstone does not connect directly to the VNC port, located in the VM template. Sunstone creates an SSH tunnel to the VNC port on any available port.{{< /alert >}}

### OpenNebula RDP remote connection.

Sunstone also admits direct connections using RDP. This kind of connection is bound to a network interface, meaning that to enable it you must follow the following steps:

1. Go to the VM template tab and click on create or update an existing one.
2. Go to the “Advanced options” step.
3. Click on “Network”.
4. Click on attach nic or update an existing one.
5. Go to the “Advanced options” step and enable the RDP connection and all the desired configuration parameters for the connection.

![fireedge_sunstone_rdp](/images/sunstone-rdp.png)

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
To enable them on a running VM, you must follow steps 3 to 5 once you click the VM you want.{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
For RDP connections to work, a service such as [XRPD](https://www.xrdp.org/) is required on the VM to which you want to connect. Also, depending on the configuration of your RDP service, the following parameters can be added in the context of the VM:

| Attribute      | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RDP_SECURITY` | You can change the type of security that the `opennebula-guacd` service will use (it must be the same as the one configured in the RDP service of the VM). By default it uses `rdp`. |
| `RDP_PORT`     | You can change the port that the `opennebula-guacd` service will use. By default it uses port `3389`.                                                                                |

  - **Schema**: Changes the color scheme to be used for the terminal session. It consists of a series of name-value pairs separated by semicolons. Each name-value pair is separated by a colon and assigns a value to a color in the terminal emulator palette. For example:

    > ```default
    > foreground: rgb:00/00/ff;
    > background: rgb:ff/ff/ff;
    > color9: rgb:80/00/80

    > > - **background**: Set the default background color.
    > > - **colorN**: Set the color at index N on the Xterm 256-color palette. For example, color9 refers to the red color.
    > >   : - **rgb:RR/GG/BB**: Use the specified color in RGB format, with each component in hexadecimal. For example: `rgb:ff/00/00` - **colorN**: Use the color currently assigned to index `N` on the Xterm 256-color palette.
    > >   <br/>
    > >   For backward compatibility, it will also accept four special values as the color scheme parameter:
    > > - **black-white**: Black text over a white background.
    > > - **gray-black**: Gray text over a black background. This is the default color scheme.
    > > - **green-black**: Green text over a black background.
    > > - **white-black**: White text over a black background.

  - **Font Name**: The name of the font to use. This parameter is optional. If not specified, the default of “mono-space” will be used instead.
