<!--# Overview -->

This section describes how to create and manage Virtual Machines.  You will find descriptions of how VMs are defined in [Virtual Machine Templates]({{% relref "vm_templates" %}}), which are _instantiated_ to become Virtual Machines, i.e. [Virtual Machine Instances]({{% relref "vm_instances" %}}). There is also information on disk [Images]({{% relref "images" %}})

## Hypervisor Compatibility

These guides are compatible with all hypervisors.
