### Hosts SAN Configuration

In the end, the abstraction required to access LUNs is just block devices. This means that there are
several ways to set them up, although it will usually involve using a network block protocol such as
iSCSI or Fibre Channel, as well as some way to make it redundant, like DM Multipath.

Here is a sample session for setting up access via iSCSI and multipath:

```
# === ISCSI ===

TARGET_IP="192.168.1.100"                             # IP of SAN appliance
TARGET_IQN="iqn.2023-01.com.example:storage.target1"  # iSCSI Qualified Name

# === Install tools ===
# RedHat derivates:
sudo dnf install -y iscsi-initiator-utils
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y open-iscsi

# === Enable iSCSI services ===
# RedHat derivates:
sudo systemctl enable --now iscsid
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo systemctl enable --now open-iscsi

# === Discover targets ===
sudo iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p "$TARGET_IP"

# === Log in to the target ===
sudo iscsiadm -m node -T "$TARGET_IQN" -p "$TARGET_IP" --login

# === Make login persistent across reboots ===
sudo iscsiadm -m node -T "$TARGET_IQN" -p "$TARGET_IP" \
     --op update -n node.startup -v automatic
```

```
# === MULTIPATH ===

# === Install tools ===
# RedHat derivates:
sudo dnf install -y device-mapper-multipath
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y multipath-tools

# === Enable multipath daemon ===
sudo systemctl enable --now multipathd

# === Create multipath config file ===
sudo tee /etc/multipath.conf > /dev/null <<EOF
defaults {
    user_friendly_names yes
    find_multipaths yes
}
# Optional: blacklist local boot disks if needed
# blacklist {
#     devnode "^sd[a-z]"
# }
EOF

# === Reload multipath ===
sudo multipath -F    # Flush existing config (safely if not in use)
sudo multipath       # Re-scan for multipath devices
sudo systemctl restart multipathd

# === Show current multipath devices ===
sudo multipath -ll
```

## Front-end Configuration

The Front-end needs access to the shared SAN server in order to perform LVM operations. It can
either access it directly, or using some host(s) as proxy/bridge.

For direct access, **the Front-end will need to be configured in the same way as hosts**, and no
further configuration will be needed. Example for illustration purposes:

```
-------------
| Front-end | ---- /dev/mapper/mpath* ------+
-------------     (iSCSI + multipath)       |
                                            |
                                            v
  ---------                              --------------
  | host2 | ---- /dev/mapper/mpath* ---> | SAN server |
  ---------     (iSCSI + multipath)      --------------
                                            ^
                                            |
  ---------                                 |
  | hostN | ---- /dev/mapper/mpath* --------+
  ---------     (iSCSI + multipath)
```

Alternatively, you can delegate front-end SAN operations to one or more specific hosts by setting the `BRIDGE_LIST` attribute in the System datastore. The front-end will then use one of the hosts in the list to proxy SAN operations. Note that only a reduced set of operations are initiated in the front-end, only for undeployed VMs.

## Troubleshooting

### LVM Devices File

**Problem:** LVM does not show my iSCSI/multipath devices (with e.g., `pvs`), although I can see them
with `multipath -ll` or `lsblk`.

**Possible solution:**

The LVM version in some operating systems or Linux distributions, by default,
doesn't scan the whole `/dev` directory for possible disks. Instead, you need to explicitly
**whitelist** them in `/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices`. You can check whether that's your case by
running:

```
lvmconfig --type full devices/use_devicesfile
```

If it returns `devices/use_devicesfile=1`, then the devices file is being used and enforced. In that
case, just add the device path to the whitelist and check again:

```
# echo /dev/mapper/mpatha >> /etc/lvm/devices/system.devices
# pvs
```
