This guide describes how to use PCI network devices as OpenNebula network interfaces.

OpenNebula extends the generic PCI passthrough mechanism by integrating PCI network devices with the Virtual Network subsystem. This allows virtual machines to benefit from the performance of direct device assignment while preserving the OpenNebula networking workflow, including IP address management, MAC address allocation, scheduling, and contextualization.

General host preparation, including IOMMU, VFIO, Huge Pages, SR-IOV configuration, and PCI monitoring, is described in the [Host Configuration]({{% relref "product/cluster_configuration/pci_passthrough_sriov/host_configuration" %}}) guide.

## Overview

OpenNebula supports assigning both Physical Functions (PFs) and Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Virtual Functions (VFs) as network interfaces.

Unlike generic PCI devices, network interfaces can be fully integrated with OpenNebula Virtual Networks. During deployment, OpenNebula:

* Selects a PCI device matching the requested constraints.
* Allocates networking resources from the selected Virtual Network.
* Assigns MAC and IP addresses.
* Configures VLAN parameters when required.
* Contextualizes the guest operating system.

This provides the performance benefits of PCI passthrough while preserving the operational model of OpenNebula networking.

## Physical Functions and Virtual Functions

Modern network adapters commonly implement Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), allowing a single Physical Function (PF) to expose multiple lightweight Virtual Functions (VFs):
* **Physical Functions**: A Physical Function represents the complete PCI device. Assigning a PF gives a virtual machine exclusive access to the network adapter and all of its capabilities.
* **Virtual Functions**: A Virtual Function is an independent PCI function created by the Physical Function. Each VF can be assigned independently to a virtual machine while sharing the underlying hardware resources.

Virtual Functions are typically used for cloud and NFV deployments because they provide excellent performance while allowing multiple virtual machines to share the same physical adapter.

### Legacy and Switchdev Modes

OpenNebula supports both SR-IOV operating modes.

* **Legacy Mode**: In Legacy mode, OpenNebula programs the Virtual Function directly. The following attributes are supported:
    * MAC
    * VLAN_ID
    * TRUST
    * SPOOFCHK
<br>

    These attributes are applied directly by the network adapter.

* **Switchdev Mode**: In Switchdev mode, VF parameters are controlled by host-side representor interfaces. These representor interfaces can be attached to a virtual switch to establish port-level control.

    In this mode, only the MAC address is applied directly to the VF interface. All other control parameters are managed by the virtual switch driver associated with the Virtual Network.

    OpenNebula automatically configures the representor interface during deployment. As of now, only Open vSwitch is supported for Switchdev mode.

## Host Configuration

If the PCI device supports Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), Virtual Functions (VFs) can be created and assigned independently to virtual machines. Determine the maximum number of supported Virtual Functions:

```shell
cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<PCI_ADDRESS>/sriov_totalvfs
```

Enable the desired number of Virtual Functions:

```shell
echo 8 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<PCI_ADDRESS>/sriov_numvfs
```

{{< alert title="Note" type="primary" >}}
The configured number of Virtual Functions is typically reset after reboot. Refer to your Linux distribution or hardware vendor documentation to configure persistent SR-IOV devices.{{< /alert >}} 

### Verification

Verify that the Virtual Functions have been created:

```shell
lspci
```

or

```shell
ip link
```

depending on the device type.

Additional SR-IOV configuration for network adapters is described in the **Network Interfaces** guide.

## Host Configuration for DPDK Interfaces

## Using PCI Devices as Network Interfaces

To use a PCI device as a network interface, set the `TYPE` attribute of the `PCI` element to `NIC`. Example:

```default
PCI = [
  TYPE = "NIC",
  NETWORK = "SRIOV-NET"
]
```

Unlike generic PCI passthrough, a PCI device configured as a network interface becomes part of the OpenNebula networking subsystem.

During deployment, OpenNebula:

1. Selects a compatible PCI device.  
2. Allocates networking resources from the specified Virtual Network.  
3. Configures the PCI device.  
4. Generates the corresponding NIC context information.  
5. Contextualizes the guest operating system.

As a result, the guest receives a fully configured network interface without additional manual configuration.

## Selecting PCI Devices

PCI devices may be selected explicitly or automatically.

### Automatic Selection

Automatic selection is the recommended approach. Instead of specifying a PCI address, define the required device characteristics.

Example:

```
PCI = [
  TYPE = "NIC",
  NETWORK = "SRIOV-NET",

  CLASS = "0200",
  VENDOR = "15b3"
]
```

The scheduler automatically selects an available PCI device satisfying the specified constraints. Automatic selection improves workload portability across hosts.

### Explicit Device Selection

Specific devices may also be selected using their PCI address.

Example:

```
PCI = [
  TYPE = "NIC",
  DEVICE = "0000:81:00.4"
]
```

Explicit selection should generally be reserved for specialized deployments where the VM needs to be attached to specific networks.

## Virtual Network Integration

Unlike generic PCI passthrough, PCI network interfaces participate fully in OpenNebula Virtual Networks. The selected Virtual Network provides:

* MAC address allocation  
* IPv4 allocation  
* IPv6 allocation  
* VLAN configuration  
* Security Groups  
* Address management

This allows PCI passthrough interfaces to behave consistently with virtual network interfaces from the administrator's perspective.

## Contextualization

When the Context package is installed inside the guest operating system, OpenNebula automatically configures the assigned PCI interface. The guest receives:

* MAC address  
* IPv4 address  
* IPv6 address  
* Network mask  
* Gateway  
* DNS configuration  
* Hostname

No manual network configuration is required inside the guest.

## Supported PCI Attributes

PCI network interfaces support the standard PCI attributes together with networking-specific attributes.

Common PCI attributes include:

* `DEVICE`  
* `CLASS`  
* `VENDOR`  
* `TYPE`

Network-specific attributes include:

* `NETWORK`  
* `NETWORK_UNAME`  
* `MAC`  
* `IP`  
* `IP6`  
* `VLAN_ID`  
* `TRUST`  
* `SPOOFCHK`

Refer to the Virtual Machine Template reference for a complete description of each attribute.

Refer to the Virtual Machine Template reference for a complete description of each attribute.

## Guest Verification

After deployment, verify that the guest detects the assigned network adapter.

Display the PCI devices:

```shell
lspci
```

Display the network interfaces:

```shell
ip link
```

The interface should appear as a native PCI network adapter and be configured automatically through contextualization.

## Best Practices

* Prefer automatic PCI device selection whenever possible.  
* Use Virtual Functions instead of Physical Functions for cloud deployments.  
* Reserve Physical Functions for workloads requiring exclusive device ownership.  
* Configure PCI monitoring to expose only passthrough devices.  
* Install the OpenNebula Context package in guest operating systems.  
* Use NUMA-aware placement for latency-sensitive workloads.  
* Prefer Switchdev mode when integrating with Open vSwitch.
