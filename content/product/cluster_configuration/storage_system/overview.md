<!--# Overview -->

## How Should I Read This Chapter

Before performing the operations outlined in this chapter, familiarize with Node Deployment from the [Installation]({{% relref "../../../software/installation_process" %}}) guide.

After that, proceed with the specific Datastore documentation you might be interested in.

## Datastore Types

Storage in OpenNebula is designed around the concept of datastores. A datastore is any storage medium to store disk images. OpenNebula distinguishes between three different datastore types:

* **Images Datastore**, which stores the base operating system images, persistent data volumes, CD-ROMs.
* **System Datastore** holds disks of running Virtual Machines. Disk are moved from/to the Images when the VMs are deployed/terminated.
* **Files & Kernels Datastore** to store plain files (not disk images), e.g. kernels, ramdisks, or contextualization files. [See details here]({{% relref "file_ds#file-ds" %}}).

<sup>\*</sup> Additional options available by mounting remote filesystems in the frontend.

### Other storage options

As an admin, restrict the usage of some storage options because these give low-level access to hosts and could become a serious security risk. Please read carefully the corresponding documentation before using them:
