<!--# Equinix Provider -->

An Equinix provider contains the credentials to interact with Equinix and also the location to deploy your Provisions. By default, OpenNebula comes with four pre-defined providers in the following regions:

* Amsterdam
* Parsippany (NJ, US)
* Tokyo
* California (US)

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
More zones can be added modifying the provider configuration. You can learn more about how to modify or expand a provider behaviour in this [Guide]().
{{< /alert >}}

In order to define an Equinix provider, you need the following information:

* **Credentials**: these are used to interact with the remote provider. You need to provide `token` and `project`. You can follow [this guide](https://metal.equinix.com/developers/api/) to get this data.
* **Facility**: this is the location in the world where the resources are going to be deployed. All the available [facilities are listed here](https://www.equinix.com/data-centers/).
* **Plans and OS**: these define the capacity of the resources that are going to be deployed and the operating system that is going to be installed on them.

Please note even though Equinix support multiple OSs, the automation tools are tailored to works with `Ubuntu 22.04`. If you use another OS, please be aware that it might required some adjustments, and things might not work as expected. Avoid using a different OS in production environment unless you‚Äôve properly tested it before.

## How to Create an Equinix Provider

The following process describes how to register the Equinix provider in your OpenNebula installation and makes it available for future provisioning operations:

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The Equinix driver is included by default with OpenNebula, so no additional setup is required before registration.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< tabpane text=true right=false >}}
{{% tab header="**Interfaces**:" disabled=true /%}}
{{% tab header="CLI"%}}

To register the Equinix driver and create all associated templates, simply use the `oneform register` command:

```default
$ oneform register equinix
```

Once registered, a provider template will be automatically created and stored in the OpenNebula database. You can verify its existence using the `oneprovider-template list` command:

```default
$ oneprovider-template list
  ID USER       GROUP      NAME                       REGTIME
  0  oneadmin   oneadmin   Equinix                    06/05 07:38:45
```

This template can now be instantiated using the `oneprovider-template instantiate` command. During instantiation, OneForm will prompt you for the necessary Equinix credentials and region:

```default
$ oneprovider-template instantiate 0
There are some parameters that require user input.
  * (auth_token) Equinix Auth Token [type: string]
    *************************
  * (project_id) Equinix Project ID [type: string]
    ***************
  * (region) Equinix Region [type: string]
    0: am
    1: ty
    2: sv
    4: ny

    Press enter for default (am). Please type the selection number: 0

ID: 1
```

Once the provider has been instantiated, you can review its details using the `oneprovider show <id>` command:

```default
$ oneprovider show 1
PROVIDER 1 INFORMATION
ID                  : 1

Congratulations! üëè If you've completed the previous steps, you've successfully created your Equinix provider in OpenNebula.

## Known Issues

### Insufficient capacity on Equinix Metal

Sometimes there may not be enough hardware available at a given Equinix Metal facility for a given machine type, in which case the following error is shown:

```default
The facility ams1 has no provisionable c3.small.x86 servers matching your criteria
```

In this case, either select a different node type or Equinix Metal provider. You can check the current capacity status on the Equinix Metal API.
