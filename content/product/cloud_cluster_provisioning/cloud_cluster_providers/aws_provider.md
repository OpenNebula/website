<!--# Amazon AWS Provider -->

An AWS provider contains the credentials to interact with Amazon and also the region to deploy your Provisions. By default, OpenNebula comes with four pre-defined AWS providers in the following regions:

* Frankfurt
* London
* North Virginia (US)
* North California (US)

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
More zones can be added modifying the provider configuration. You can learn more about how to modify or expand a provider behaviour in this [Guide]().
{{< /alert >}}

In order to define an AWS provider, you need the following information:

* **Credentials**: these are used to interact with the remote provider. You need to provide `access_key` and `secret_key`. You can follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).
* **Region**: this is the location in the world where the resources are going to be allocated. All the available regions are [listed here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html).
* **Instance types and AMI‚Äôs**: these define the capacity of the resources that are going to be deployed and the operating system that is going to be installed on them.

Please note even though custom AMIs (i.e other than the default one) can be used, the automation tools are tailored to works with these default ones. If you use a custom AMI, please be aware that it might required some adjustments, and things might not work as expected. Avoid using them in production environment unless you‚Äôve properly tested it before.

## How to Create an AWS Provider

The following process describes how to register the AWS provider in your OpenNebula installation and makes it available for future provisioning operations:

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The AWS driver is included by default with OpenNebula, so no additional setup is required before registration.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< tabpane text=true right=false >}}
{{% tab header="**Interfaces**:" disabled=true /%}}
{{% tab header="CLI"%}}

To register the AWS driver and create all associated templates, simply use the `oneform register` command:

```default
$ oneform register aws
```

Once registered, a provider template will be automatically created and stored in the OpenNebula database. You can verify its existence using the `oneprovider-template list` command:

```default
$ oneprovider-template list
  ID USER       GROUP      NAME                       REGTIME
  0  oneadmin   oneadmin   AWS                        06/05 07:36:43
```

This template can now be instantiated using the `oneprovider-template instantiate` command. During instantiation, OneForm will prompt you for the necessary AWS credentials and region:

```default
$ oneprovider-template instantiate 0
There are some parameters that require user input.
  * (access_key) AWS Access Key [type: string]
    ***************
  * (secret_key) AWS Secret Key [type: string]
    ************************
  * (region) AWS Region [type: string]
    0: eu-central-1
    1: eu-west-1

    Press enter for default (eu-central-1). Please type the selection number: 0

ID: 1
```

Once the provider has been instantiated, you can review its details using the `oneprovider show <id>` command:

```default
$ oneprovider show 1
