<!--# Scaleway Provider -->

A Scaleway provider contains the credentials to interact with Scaleway and also the location to deploy your Provisions. By default, OpenNebula comes with three pre-defined providers in the following regions:

* France - Paris (PAR-1)
* Netherlands - Amsterdam (NL-AMS-1 )
* Poland - Warsaw (PL-WAW-3)

In order to define a Scaleway provider, you need the following information:

* **Credentials**: these are used to interact with the remote provider. You need to provide `access_key`, `secret_key` and `project_id`. You can follow [this guide](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys//) to get this data.
* **Zone**: this is the location in the world where the resources are going to be deployed. All the available [zones are listed here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/console/account/reference-content/products-availability/).
* **Offers and OS**: these define the capacity of the resources that are going to be deployed and the operating system that is going to be installed on them.

Please note even though Scaleway support multiple OSs, the automation tools are tailored to works with `Ubuntu 22.04`. If you use another OS, please be aware that it might required some adjustments, and things might not work as expected. Avoid using a different OS in production environment unless you‚Äôve properly tested it before.

## How to Create an Scaleway Provider

The following process describes how to register the Scaleway provider in your OpenNebula installation and makes it available for future provisioning operations:

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The Scaleway driver is included by default with OpenNebula, so no additional setup is required before registration.
{{< /alert >}}

{{% tab header="**Interfaces**:" disabled=true /%}}
{{% tab header="CLI"%}}

To register the Scaleway driver and create all associated templates, simply use the `oneform register` command:

```default
$ oneform register scaleway
```

Once registered, a provider template will be automatically created and stored in the OpenNebula database. You can verify its existence using the `oneprovider-template list` command:

```default
$ oneprovider-template list
  ID USER       GROUP      NAME                       REGTIME
  0  oneadmin   oneadmin   Scaleway                   06/05 10:02:38
```

This template can now be instantiated using the `oneprovider-template instantiate` command. During instantiation, OneForm will prompt you for the necessary Scaleway credentials and region:

```default
$ oneprovider-template instantiate 0
There are some parameters that require user input.
  * (access_key) Scaleway Access Key [type: string]
    ***************
  * (secret_key) Scaleway Secret Key [type: string]
    ************************
  * (project_id) Scaleway Project ID [type: string]
    *******************
  * (region) Scaleway Region [type: string]
    0: fr-par
    1: nl-ams
    2: pl-waw

    Press enter for default (fr-par). Please type the selection number: 0
  * (zone) Scaleway Zone [type: string]
    0: fr-par-1
    1: fr-par-2
    2: fr-par-3

    Press enter for default (fr-par-1). Please type the selection number: 2

ID: 1
```

Once the provider has been instantiated, you can review its details using the `oneprovider show <id>` command:

```default
$ oneprovider show 1
