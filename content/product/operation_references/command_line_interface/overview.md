<!--# Overview -->

Here you will find information about the core command-line interfaces and support utilities available to manage and diagnose an OpenNebula installation.

## How Should I Read This Chapter

[Command Line Interface (CLI)]({{% relref "cli" %}}): provides a comprehensive reference for the suite of one* commands (e.g., onevm, onehost, onedatastore) used for full lifecycle management of cloud resources. 

[Command Line Interface Configuration]({{% relref "cli_configuration" %}}): details the configuration of the shell environment using variables like `ONE_XMLRPC´ and `ONE_AUTH´, and explains how to customize CLI output formats.

[Support Utilities (EE)]({{% relref "support" %}}): focuses on the OpenNebula Enterprise Edition (EE) tool, onegather. This utility is designed to quickly generate detailed diagnostic support bundles containing crucial information—such as OS logs, kernel information, database dumps (optional), and OpenNebula configuration—to assist in troubleshooting and resolving support cases. It outlines the various command flags for customizing the collected data.
