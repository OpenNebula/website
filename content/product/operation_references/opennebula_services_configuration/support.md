<!--# Support Utilities (EE) -->

OpenNebula provides customers with means to generate diagnostic bundles with all details necessary to handle support cases. The OpenNebula server package contains [OneGather]({{% relref "#support-bundle" %}}), a specialized tool that generates an archive bundle with information about the OpenNebula instance, such as configuration, database and hosts state.

This feature is available only in OpenNebula **Enterprise Edition**.{{< /alert >}}

## Generate Support Bundle

If there are no special requirements, the support diagnostic bundle can be generated just by running `onegather` **on the frontend** without any extra parameters. The command must be running under **privileged user** (directly by `root` or via `sudo`). For example:

For most support issues it’s enough to provide just a limited support bundle with Front-end only specific information and without database dumps. The limited bundle can be generated by running:

```default
$ sudo onegather
```

{{< alert title="Important" color="success" >}}
If you are running your Front-end in a federation, OneGather will prompt you in the result section to run it on all other nodes.{{< /alert >}} 

The command generates a diagnostic bundle archive and puts it into `/tmp/`. The precise file location is shown at the end of the terminal output. If the support team asks you for a database dump, you can add it to the bundle archive with the `--db` flag:

```default
$ sudo onegather --db
```

You can also provide a bundle with every piece of information with the `--all` flag:

```default
$ sudo onegather --all

-> NOTICE: Fact gathering complete. Generating TAR bundle:

** Results **
-> Bundle: /tmp/d20230926-2610-1j3xs6i

-> Bundle size is:

-> NOTICE: Front-end is in STANDALONE mode.
```

Note that with more information required for the bundle it will take longer to generate, and the size will be bigger. The database dump is especially time consuming and big. You can take a look at every option available with `onegather --help`.
