<!--# FireEdge Configuration -->

The OpenNebula FireEdge server provides a **next-generation web-management interface** for remote OpenNebula Cluster provisioning as well as additional functionality to Sunstone. Itâ€™s a dedicated daemon installed by default as part of the [Single Front-end Installation]({{% relref "front_end_installation" %}}), but can be deployed independently on a different machine. The server is distributed as an operating system package `opennebula-fireedge` with the system service `opennebula-fireedge`.

## Main Features

- **Guacamole Proxy** for Sunstone to remotely access the VMs (incl., VNC, RDP, and SSH)
- **FireEdge Sunstone**: new iteration of Sunstone written in React/Redux. Accessible through the following URL:

```default
http://<OPENNEBULA-FRONTEND>:2616
```

After a configuration change, the FireEdge server must be [restarted]({{% relref "fireedge#fireedge-conf-service" %}}) to take effect.{{< /alert >}}

Once the server is initialized, it creates the file `/var/lib/one/.one/fireedge_key`, used to encrypt communication with Guacd.

<a id="fireedge-in-ha"></a>

In HA environments, `fireedge_key` needs to be copied from the first leader to the followers. Optionally, in order to have the provision logs available in all the HA nodes, `/var/lib/one/fireedge` needs to be shared between nodes.

## Tuning and Extending

<a id="fireedge-branding"></a>

### Branding FireEdge

You can add your logo to the login, main, favicon, and loading screens by updating the `logo:` attribute as follows:

- The logo configuration is done in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/sunstone-views.yaml` file.
- The logo of the main UI screen is defined for each view.

The logo image must be copied to `/usr/lib/one/fireedge/dist/client/assets/images/logos`.

The following example shows how you can change the logo to a generic linux one (included by default in all FireEdge installations):

```yaml
# /etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/sunstone-views.yaml
---
logo: linux.png

groups:
    oneadmin:
        - admin
        - user
default:
    - user
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The logo can be updated without having to restart the FireEdge server!{{< /alert >}}

<a id="fireedge-conf-guacamole"></a>

### Configure Tables

Tables in Sunstone can be configured to visualize data as a list of plain text or as a list of cards:

![fireedge_sunstone_list_datatable](/images/sunstone_list_datatable.png)

![fireedge_sunstone_card_datatable](/images/sunstone_card_datatable.png)

This configuration could be modified in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/sunstone-server.conf` file modifying the parameter `rowStyle`. See [table below](fireedge#fireedge-sunstone-configuration).

Moreover, Suntone has the capacity to show the detail of a resource in a full screen mode or in a split mode:

![fireedge_sunstone_resource_full_mode](/images/sunstone_resource_full_mode.png)

![fireedge_sunstone_resource_split_mode](/images/sunstone_resource_split_mode.png)

This configuration can be modified in the `/etc/one/fireedge/sunstone/views/sunstone-server.conf` file modifying the parameter `fullViewMode`. See [table below](#fireedge-sunstone-configuration).

Also, both configurations will be overridden for a specific user if the user changes the configuration in the settings section.

![fireedge_sunstone_setting_list_datatable](/images/sunstone_setting_list_datatable.png)

### Customize colors

Sunstone will store the colors used in its components in two different files:

- For light mode: `src/modules/providers/theme/palettes/light.js`
- For dark mode: `src/modules/providers/theme/palettes/dark.js`

These two files store a JSON object that has the same structure but with different values in order to set colors for light and dark mode.

| Key             | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mainContainer   | Defines the background color of the app.                     |
| buttons         | Defines the different colors used in buttons.                |
| tables          | Defines the different colors used in resource tables.        |
| tabs            | Defines the different colors used in the component tabs, the one used in the details of a resource. |
| searchBar       | Defines the different colors used in the search bar placed over all the resource tables. |
| sidebar         | Defines the different colors used in the sidebar menu.       |
| scrollbar       | Defines the color of the scrollbar.                          |
| login           | Defines the different colors used in login.                  |
| switchViewTable | Defines the different colors used in the button to switch between view types. |
| breadCrumb      | Defines the different colors used in the breadcrumb.         |
| topbar          | Defines the different colors used in the topbar of the app.  |
| footer          | Defines the different colors used in the footer of the app.  |
| graphs          | Defines the different colors used in the different graphs used in the app. |

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
Remember that these files are source files, so any change on this configuration will force Sunstone to be compiled again in order to apply these changes. See [Sunstone Development]({{% relref "../../../software/installation_process/build_from_source_code/sunstone_dev" %}})):{{< /alert >}} 

### Configure Guacamole

FireEdge uses [Apache Guacamole](http://guacamole.apache.org), a free and open source web application that allows you to access a remote console or desktop of the Virtual Machine anywhere using a modern web browser. It is a clientless **remote desktop gateway** which only requires Guacamole installed on a server and a web browser supporting HTML5.

Guacamole supports multiple connection methods such as **VNC, RDP, and SSH** and is made up of two separate parts - server and client. The Guacamole server consists of the native server-side libraries required to connect to the server and the Guacamole proxy daemon (`guacd`), which accepts the userâ€™s requests and connects to the remote desktop on their behalf.

{{< alert title="Note" color="success" >}}
The OpenNebula **binary packages** provide Guacamole proxy daemon (package `opennebula-guacd` and service `opennebula-guacd`), which is installed alongside FireEdge. In the default configuration, the Guacamole proxy daemon is automatically started along with FireEdge, and FireEdge is configured to connect to the locally-running Guacamole. No extra steps are required!{{< /alert >}} 

If Guacamole is running on a different Host to the FireEdge, the following FireEdge configuration parameters have to be customized:

- `guacd/host`
- `guacd/port`

<a id="fireedge-conf-service"></a>

### Service Control and Logs

Change the server running state by managing the operating system service `opennebula-fireedge`.

To start, restart, or stop the server, execute one of:

```default
$ systemctl start   opennebula-fireedge
$ systemctl restart opennebula-fireedge
$ systemctl stop    opennebula-fireedge
```

To enable or disable automatic start on host boot, execute one of:

```default
$ systemctl enable  opennebula-fireedge
$ systemctl disable opennebula-fireedge
```

Server **logs** are located in `/var/log/one` in the following files:

- `/var/log/one/fireedge.log`: operational log.
- `/var/log/one/fireedge.error`: errors and exceptions log.

Other logs are also available in Journald. Use the following command to show them:

```default
$ journalctl -u opennebula-fireedge.service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Conflicting Port

A common issue when starting FireEdge is a used port:

```default
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:2616
```

If another service is using the port, you can change FireEdge configuration (`/etc/one/fireedge-server.conf`) to use another Host/port.
