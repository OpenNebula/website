<!--# OneFlow Configuration -->

OneFlow **orchestrates multi-VM services** as a whole, interacts with the OpenNebula Daemon to manage the Virtual Machines (starts, stops), and can be controlled via the Sunstone GUI or over CLI. It’s a dedicated daemon installed by default as part of the [Single Front-end Installation]({{% relref "front_end_installation" %}}), but can be deployed independently on a different machine. The server is distributed as an operating system package `opennebula-flow` with the system service `opennebula-flow`.

Read more in [Multi-VM Service Management]({{% relref "../../virtual_machines_operation/multi-vm_workflows/index#multivm-service-management" %}}).

## Configuration

The OneFlow configuration file can be found in `/etc/one/oneflow-server.conf` on your Front-end. It uses **YAML** syntax, with the parameters listed in the table below.

After a configuration change, the OneFlow server must be [restarted]({{% relref "oneflow#oneflow-conf-service" %}}) to take effect.{{< /alert >}}

For a quick view of any changes in configuration file options in maintenance releases, check the Resolved Issues page in the [Release Notes]({{% relref "../../../software/release_information/release_notes_enterprise/index#rn-enterprise" %}}) for the release. Please note that even in the case of changes (such as a new option available), you do *not* need to update your configuration files unless you wish to change the application’s behavior.{{< /alert >}}

In the default configuration, the OneFlow server will only listen to requests coming from `localhost` (which is enough to control OneFlow over Sunstone running on the same Host). If you want to control OneFlow over API/CLI remotely, you need to change `:host` parameter in `/etc/one/oneflow-server.conf` to a public IP of your Front-end Host or to `0.0.0.0` (to work on all IP addresses configured on Host).

### Configure Sunstone

Sunstone GUI enables end users to access the OneFlow from the UI and it directly connects to OneFlow on their behalf. Sunstone has configured the OneFlow endpoint it connects to in `/etc/one/fireedge-server.conf` in parameter `:oneflow_server`. When OneFlow is running on a different Host than Sunstone, the endpoint in Sunstone must be configured appropriately.

Sunstone tabs for OneFlow (*Services* and *Service Templates*) are enabled in Sunstone by default. To customize visibility for different types of users, follow the [Sunstone Views]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/multitenancy/fireedge_sunstone_views#fireedge-suns-views" %}}) documentation.

### Configure CLI

OneFlow CLI (`oneflow` and `oneflow-template`) uses same credentials as other [command-line tools]({{% relref "../configuration_references/cli#cli" %}}). The login and password are taken from the file referenced by environment variable `$ONE_AUTH` (defaults to `$HOME/.one/one_auth`). Remote endpoint and (optionally) distinct user/password access to the above is configured in environment variable `$ONEFLOW_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:2474`), `$ONEFLOW_USER` and `$ONEFLOW_PASSWORD`.

Example:

```default
$ ONEFLOW_URL=http://one.example.com:2474 oneflow list
```

See more in [Managing Users documentation]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/multitenancy/manage_users#manage-users-shell" %}}).

## Service Control and Logs

Change the server running state by managing the operating system service `opennebula-flow`.

To start, restart, or stop the server, execute one of:

```default
# systemctl start   opennebula-flow
# systemctl restart opennebula-flow
# systemctl stop    opennebula-flow
```

To enable or disable automatic start on Host boot, execute one of:

```default
# systemctl enable  opennebula-flow
# systemctl disable opennebula-flow
```

Server **logs** are located in `/var/log/one` in following files:

- `/var/log/one/oneflow.log`
- `/var/log/one/oneflow.error`

Logs of individual multi-VM Services managed by OneFlow can be found in

- `/var/log/one/oneflow/$ID.log` where `$ID` identifies the service

Other logs are also available in Journald. Use the following command to show:

```default
# journalctl -u opennebula-flow.service
```

## Advanced Setup

### Permission to Create Services

*Documents* are special types of resources in OpenNebula used by OneFlow to store *Service Templates* and information about *Services*. When a new user Group is created, you can decide if you want to allow/deny its users to create *Documents* (and also OneFlow Services). By default, [new groups]({{% relref "../../cloud_system_administration/multitenancy/manage_groups#manage-groups" %}}) are allowed to create Document resources.
