<!--# Overview -->

This chapter is a configuration and deployment reference for all OpenNebula services. It contains the description of the configuration files (for least effort, basic and even advanced setups), how to stop and start them, and where to find their logs.

## How Should I Read This Chapter

Read the sections for services you are interested in

- [OpenNebula Daemon]({{% relref "oned#oned-conf" %}})
- [FireEdge]({{% relref "fireedge#fireedge-conf" %}})
- [OneFlow]({{% relref "oneflow#oneflow-conf" %}})
- [OneGate]({{% relref "onegate#onegate-conf" %}})

Move on to [Database Maintenance]({{% relref "database#database-maintenance" %}}) and [Troubleshooting]({{% relref "troubleshooting#troubleshoot" %}}).

Users of **Enterprise Edition** might find [Support Utilities]({{% relref "support#support" %}}) useful, which generates support bundles with detailed information about the cloud environment of the customer. The bundles help OpenNebula Customer Care to provide better support responses.

## Hypervisor Compatibility

This chapter applies to all the hypervisors.
