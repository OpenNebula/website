<!--# Image States Reference -->

This page is a complete reference of all the Image states that will be useful for developers and administrators doing troubleshooting.

The simplified life-cycle is explained in the [Virtual Machines Images guide]({{% relref "../../virtual_machines_operation/virtual_machines/images#images-states" %}}). This simplified diagram uses a smaller number of state names. That section should be enough for end users and everyday administration tasks.

## List of States

OpenNebulaâ€™s images define their state using the `STATE` variable. The state can be seen from the CLI (`oneimage show`) and from Sunstone (Info panel for the Image).

|   # | State            | Short State Alias   | Meaning                                           |
