## Appliance Description

The Rancher CAPI appliance provides a fully preconfigured environment with [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) and the [Turtles](https://turtles.docs.rancher.com/turtles/stable) extension installed and integrated. It ensures seamless detection of OpenNebula as an infrastructure provider and allows users to manage OpenNebula CAPI [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) clusters directly from the Rancher web interface.

## Main Features

This appliance comes with a set of preinstalled components designed to streamline Kubernetes cluster management on OpenNebula:

* Rancher running on a lightweight [K3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster, along with the Turtles extension.
* [Cluster API provider for OpenNebula](https://github.com/OpenNebula/cluster-api-provider-opennebula) (CAPONE) imported as an infrastructure provider.
* RKE2 and Kubeadm charts to simplify cluster deployments.
