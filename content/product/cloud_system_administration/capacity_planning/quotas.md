<!--# Usage Quotas -->

The quota system tracks user and group usage of system resources, and allows the system administrator to set limits on the usage of these resources. Quota limits can be set for:

* **users**, to individually limit the usage by a given user.
* **groups**, to limit the overall usage by all the users in a given group. This can be of special interest for the OpenNebula Zones and Virtual Data Center (VDC) components.

## Resource Limits

The quota system allows you to track and limit usage on:

* **Datastores**, to control the amount of storage capacity allocated to each user/group for each datastore.
* **Compute**, to limit the overall memory, CPU, or VM instances.
* **Network**, to limit the number of IPs a user/group can obtain from a given network. This is especially interesting for networks with public IPs, which are usually a limited resource.
* **Images**, you can limit how many VM instances from a given user/group are using a given image. You can take advantage of this quota when the image contains consumable resources (e.g., software licenses).

## Defining User/Group Quotas

Usage quotas are set in the OpenNebula template syntax (either plain text or XML). The following tables summarize the attributes to define a quota for each resource type.

### Datastore Quotas

The attribute name is `DATASTORE`.

| DATASTORE Attribute   | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ID`                  | ID of the datastore to set the quota for                                                                  |
| `SIZE`                | Maximum size in MB that can be used in the datastore.<br/>It includes size of images and their snapshots. |
| `IMAGES`              | Maximum number of images that can be created in the datastore                                             |

### Compute Quotas

The attribute name is `VM`.

| VM Attribute       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CLUSTER_IDS`      | An optional attribute used to define which clusters are included in this<br/>quota. Leave this attribute empty to apply the quota globally.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `VMS`              | Maximum number of VMs that can be created                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `SYSTEM_DISK_SIZE` | Maximum size (in MB) of system disks that can be requested by user/group VMs.<br/>It includes size of volatile and non-persistent disks (including disk<br/>snapshots) and VM snapshots (reduced by<br/>[VM_SNAPSHOT_FACTOR]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/oned#oned-conf-datastores" %}})). |

The actual size given on the system and image datastores depends on the storage driver used. The behavior of the driver is described by the `CLONE_TARGET` and `LN_TARGET` attributes, see [Transfer Driver configuration]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/oned#oned-conf-transfer-driver" %}})

{{< alert title="Important" color="success" >}}
Running quotas will be increased or decreased depending on the state of the Virtual Machine. The states in which the machine is counted as “Running” are `ACTIVE` , `HOLD`, `PENDING`, and `CLONING`.{{< /alert >}} 

<a id="quota-auth-generic"></a>

#### Generic Quotas

Administrators have the capability to expand Compute Quotas by introducing the `QUOTA_VM_ATTRIBUTE` into the [OpenNebula configuration file]({{% relref "../../../product/operation_references/opennebula_services_configuration/oned#oned-conf" %}}). This attribute allows any numerical attribute from the Virtual Machine Template or User Template to serve as a generic quota.

As an example, one could categorize each VM template into a specific Quality of Service (QoS) category based on attributes like `CPU` and append a metric to denote this:

```default
CPU    = 12
MEMORY = 4096

...

GOLD_QOS = 1
```

Subsequently, a quota can be enforced for a user, e.g., `GOLD_QOS = 5`, meaning that the user is restricted to a maximum of 5 VMs within the `GOLD_QOS` category. Administrators have the flexibility to determine which VMs fall under a category by utilizing any combination of VM attributes. Similarly, limitations can be set on the number of PCI passthrough GPUs by adding `GPU = 1` to templates incorporating such devices…

Each generic quota is also automatically prefixed with `RUNNING_`. For instance, `RUNNING_GOLD_QOS` would specify the number of VMs in an `ACTIVE` state with the `GOLD_QOS` attribute. This allows you to define quotas specifically tailored for running VMs.

Additionally, it’s important to note that each generic quota defined with the `QUOTA_VM_ATTRIBUTE` is automatically included in the `VM_RESTRICTED_ATTR` set. This inclusion prevents regular users from circumventing the quota system by altering the attributes related to these generic quotas.

#### Per Cluster Quotas

For more granular control over Compute Quotas, use the `CLUSTER_IDS` attribute. This optional attribute specifies which clusters the quota applies to. If left empty, the quota will be applied globally. The value should be a comma-separated list of cluster IDs, and the quota will only affect VMs running in the specified clusters. Note that each cluster can be assigned to only one quota.

```default
# Global quota to allow 4 VMs
VM = [
  VMS = 4
]
# Quota for cluster 0 to allow 2 VMs
VM = [
  CLUSTER_IDS = "0",
  VMS = 2
]
# Quota for clusters 100 and 101 to allow 3 VMs
VM = [
  CLUSTER_IDS = "100,101",
  VMS = 3
]
```

In this setup, the user can run:

* Up to **2 VMs** in **cluster 0**
* Up to **3 VMs** in **clusters 100 and 101** combined
* No more than **4 VMs** in total across all clusters

### Network Quotas

The attribute name is `NETWORK`.

| NETWORK Attribute   | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `ID`                | ID of the Network to set the quota for          |
| `LEASES`            | Maximum IPs that can be leased from the Network |

### Image Quotas

The attribute name is `IMAGE`.

| IMAGE Attribute   | Description                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `ID`              | ID of the Image to set the quota for                  |
| `RVMS`            | Maximum VMs that can use this Image at the same time  |

## Quota Limits and Usage

For each quota there are two special limits:

* **-1** means that the **default quota** will be used
* **-2** means **unlimited**

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
Each quota has an associated usage counter named `<QUOTA_NAME>_USED`. For example `MEMORY_USED` means the total memory used by user/group VMs, and its associated quota is `MEMORY`.{{< /alert >}} 

The following template shows a quota example for a user in plain text. The template limits the overall usage in Datastore 0 to 20Gb (for an unlimited number of images); the number of VMs that can be created to 4, with a maximum memory of 2G and 5 CPUs; and the number of leases on network 1 to 4. Additionally, Image 1 can only be used by 3 VMs at the same time.

```default
DATASTORE=[
  ID="1",
  IMAGES="-2",
  SIZE="20480"
]

VM=[
  CPU="5",
  MEMORY="2048",
  VMS="4",
  SYSTEM_DISK_SIZE="-1"
]

NETWORK=[
  ID="1",
  LEASES="4"
]

IMAGE=[
  ID="1",
  RVMS="3"
]

IMAGE=[
  ID="2",
  RVMS="-2"
]
```

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
Note that whenever a network, image, datastore, or VM is used, the corresponding quota counters are created for the user with an unlimited value. This allows the tracking of each user/group's usage even when quotas are not used.{{< /alert >}} 

## Setting User/Group Quotas

User/group quotas can be easily set up either through the command line interface or Sunstone. Note that you need `MANAGE` permissions to set a quota of a user and `ADMIN` permissions to set the quota of a group. In this way, by default, only `oneadmin` can set quotas for a group, but if you define a group manager, this manager can set specific usage quotas for the users on their group (thus distributing resources as required). You can always change this behavior by setting the appropriate ACL rules.

To set the quota for a user, e.g., userA, just type:

```default
$ oneuser quota userA
```

This will open an editor session to edit a quota template (with some tips about the syntax).

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
Usage metrics are included for information purposes (e.g., CPU_USED, MEMORY_USED, LEASES_USED…) you cannot modify them{{< /alert >}} 

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}
You can add as many resource quotas as needed even if they have not been automatically initialized.{{< /alert >}} 

Similarly, you can set the quotas for group A with:

```default
$ onegroup quota groupA
```

The `batchquota` command allows you to set the same quotas for several users or groups:

```default
$ oneuser batchquota userA,userB,35

$ onegroup batchquota 100..104
```

## Setting Default Quotas

There are two default templates for quota limits, one for users and another for groups. This template applies to all users/groups unless they have an individual limit set.

Use the `oneuser/onegroup defaultquota` command:

```default
$ oneuser defaultquota
```

By default, the quota is set to unlimited. Once the editor opens after issuing `oneuser defaultquota` you’ll see comments regarding how to set the quotas and no quota template. Setting a quota with a template using unlimited values will translate to a blank quota. If you issue `oneuser defaultquota` again, you’ll see the same comments with blank quota. If you set a non-unlimited quota, you’ll see the value of the quota that is established as default.

Default Quotas don’t apply for Cluster Quotas, you need to set them manually.

## Checking User/Group Quotas

Quota limits and usage for each user/group are included as part of the standard information, so they can be easily checked with the usual commands. See for example:

```default
$ oneuser show uA
USER 2 INFORMATION
ID             : 2
NAME           : uA
GROUP          : gA
PASSWORD       : a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d
AUTH_DRIVER    : core
ENABLED        : Yes

## Managing Quotas with Sunstone

You can easily set the user/group quotas in Sunstone through the user/group tab. Similarly, usage and quota information is also available as part of the user/group information:
