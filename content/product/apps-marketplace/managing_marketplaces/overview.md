<!--# Overview -->

This section details the procedures for administrators and users to create, configure, and manage both Public and Private Marketplaces directly through the OpenNebula Sunstone web interface (version 7.0).

The goal is to enable users to effectively control the catalog of virtual machine and container images (Appliances) available for deployment.

The following topics are covered within this section:

[Managing Marketplace Appliances]({{% relref "marketapps#marketapps" %}}) : Instructions on importing, managing, and maintaining the virtual machine and container images, or "Appliances," that populate the marketplaces.

[Marketplaces in Sunstone]({{% relref "sunstone_marketplaces#sunstone-marketplaces" %}}) : Specific guidance on using the Marketplace functionality within the Sunstone graphical user interface, including how to browse, select, and manage the different marketplaces.
