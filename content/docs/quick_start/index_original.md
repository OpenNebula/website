<!--# Cloud Installation -->

This first chapter is designed to quickly take you from an introduction to OpenNebula to deploying your first cloud for learning and evaluation.

The first section, [Understand OpenNebula]({{% relref "understand_opennebula" %}}), provides you with a bird's eye view of the system's base concepts, key features, architecture basics, and the most common pathway from cloud design to deployment.

The second section, [Try OpenNebula with miniONE]({{% relref "try_opennebula" %}}), consists of tutorials for quickly installing an OpenNebula cloud for purposes of evaluation, testing, and even on-premises production operations. The tutorials guide you in building progressively complex infrastructure, from a basic Front-end install to automatically deploying a Kubernetes cluster.

The third section, [Automatic Deployment of OpenNebula with OneDeploy]({{% relref "automatic_deployment_of_opennebula_with_one_deploy" %}}) contains an overview and tutorials for automatically installing a production-grade OpenNebula cloud using OneDeploy, an automated installation tool based on Ansible playbooks.
