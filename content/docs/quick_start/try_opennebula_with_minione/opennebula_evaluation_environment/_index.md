<!--# Quick Start: OpenNebula Evaluation Environment [formerly Quick Start] -->

The OpenNebula Evaluation environment is designed to help you deploy an OpenNebula environment for learning, developing or testing. By following a series of tutorials, you can progressively build infrastructure from an OpenNebula **Front-end** to provisioning an **Edge Cluster**, running a **Virtual Machine**, and finally deploying a **Kubernetes cluster**.

All tutorials use OpenNebulaâ€™s **Sunstone** web UI, and most take under ten minutes to complete. The Quick Start is by far the fastest way to familiarize yourself with OpenNebula.
