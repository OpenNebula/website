<!--# EE and CE Editions -->

The Release Notes section now includes notes for CE and EE, so this would be a new page explaining the differences between the EE and CE editions, using the content from:

[What is OpenNebula CE](https://docs.opennebula.io/6.10/intro_release_notes/release_notes_community/what_is.html)

[What is OpenNebula EE](https://docs.opennebula.io/6.10/intro_release_notes/release_notes_enterprise/what_is.html)
