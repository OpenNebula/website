<!--# Overview -->

No host or service is absolutely reliable; we experience failures across various areas every day. To avoid the down-time and the consequent damages, we try to avoid a single point of failure by running several instances of the same service. Failure of one instance doesnâ€™t mean complete service unavailability, as there are other instances that can handle the workload. Such deployment is **highly available** and resilient to partial failure.

OpenNebula provides high availability mechanisms both for the Front-end and for the Virtual Machines.

## How Should I Read This Chapter

Before starting, you need to have [OpenNebula Front-end]({{% relref "front_end_installation" %}}) running.

Read the section [Front-end HA Setup]({{% relref "frontend_ha#frontend-ha-setup" %}}) to learn how to set up a highly available (HA) OpenNebula Front-end. Continue with [Virtual Machines High Availability]({{% relref "vm_ha#ftguide" %}}) if you are interested in a way to provide high availability to your Virtual Machines.
