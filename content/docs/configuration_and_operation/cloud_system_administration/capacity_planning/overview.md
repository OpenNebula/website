<!--# Overview -->

## How Should I Read This Chapter

This Chapter shows different mechanism available to administrators to control the capacity assigned to Virtual Machines as well as that available to the users:

> - First you can control the apparent capacity of [Hosts configuring its overcommitment]({{% relref "overcommitment#overcommitment" %}}).
> - Similarly, you can limit the resources that are made available to [users with the quota system]({{% relref "quotas#quota-auth" %}}).

It is also recommended to refer to the [Scheduling]({{% relref "../scheduling" %}}) section for details on controlling allocation of resources from Hosts, Datastores and Virtual Networks to Virtual Machines, and [defining VM groups]({{% relref "../scheduling/affinity#vmgroups" %}}) for setting up affinity and resource placement rules.
