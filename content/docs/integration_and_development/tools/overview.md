<!--# Overview -->

OpenNebula includes a number of extensions and plug-ins that allows the integration of OpenNebula with other open source software. In this guide we review the integration of OpenNebula with following third party tools:

> * [Ansible]({{% relref "ansible#ansible" %}}): to manage common OpenNebula resources, e.g. VMs, images or hosts, using Ansible playbooks
> * [Terraform]({{% relref "terraform#terraform" %}}): to create and manage OpenNebula clusters resources (e.g VMs, images, services, â€¦) using the OpenNebula Terraform Provider
