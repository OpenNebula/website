<!--# Whatâ€™s New in 7.0 -->

## OpenNebula Core

- The ability to import wild VMs into OpenNebula has been removed from code to provide a more coherent management experience across all interfaces and APIs.
- The enforce parameter has been restored for the resize operation. In this context, it only manages capacity enforcement checks (memory and CPU), while the NUMA topology is always verified independently.
- Option to define [Compute Quotas per Cluster]({{% relref "../../../product/cloud_system_administration/capacity_planning/quotas#compute-quotas" %}}) to achieve more granular control of resources.

## Storage & Backups

- [Integrated NFS life-cycle setup]({{% relref "../../../product/cloud_clusters_infrastructure_configuration/storage_system_configuration/nas_ds#automatic-nfs-setup" %}}) for volumes in shared datastore.

## FireEdge Sunstone

- Removed Provision/Provider as application [FireEdge Sunstone]({{% relref "../../../product/control_plane_configuration/graphical_user_interface/fireedge_sunstone#fireedge-sunstone" %}}).
- Architectural shift to Micro-Frontend as part of the Dynamic Tabs update [Sunstone development guide]({{% relref "../../../product/control_plane_configuration/graphical_user_interface/fireedge_sunstone#sunstone-dev" %}}).
- Guacamole VDI over SSH tunnel [Remote connections guide]({{% relref "../../../product/control_plane_configuration/graphical_user_interface/fireedge_sunstone#fireedge-remote-connections" %}}).
