The OpenNebula Community Marketplace is a public repository of virtual appliances and templates that are ready to be used within OpenNebula cloud environments.The Marketplace provides pre-built and tested images that users can easily import into their own OpenNebula cloud to quickly deploy virtual machines (VMs), applications, and services without having to build them from scratch.
All OpenNebula users can contribute their appliances to the Community Marketplace. It is accessible via the OpenNebula Sunstone GUI or CLI and hosted at https://community-marketplace.opennebula.io.

If you're running an OpenNebula cloud and think the other OpenNebula users may benefit from the appliances you are using, the Community Marketplace is one of the fastest ways to share them with the OpenNebula Community eliminating a necessity for everyone to build the same or similar appliances.
