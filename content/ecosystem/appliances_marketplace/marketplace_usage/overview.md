[OpenNebula Community Marketplace](https://community-marketplace.opennebula.io/) provides a simple way to integrate your cloud with popular application/image providers created by OpenNebula Community. Think of them as external datastores (more info on marketplaces and appliances can be found [here](https://docs.opennebula.io/7.0/product/apps-marketplace/)). This section explains how to add the Community Marketplace to your OpenNebula installation, import an appliance, and run it.
