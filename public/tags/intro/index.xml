      <description>To support digital transformation initiatives, IT departments need the right blend of on-premises, public and edge cloud environments to support a variety of existing and emerging use cases while avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling cost optimization. They also need to combine virtual machine workloads with containerized applications from Kubernetes in a shared environment to get the best of both worlds: mature virtualization technologies and orchestration of application containers.&#xA;This document presents a powerful distributed Edge Cloud Architecture for OpenNebula composed of Edge Clusters that can run any workload - both virtual machines and containerized applications — on any resource — bare metal or virtualized — anywhere on premises and on a cloud provider.</description>

      <description>In a small installation with a few hosts you can use OpenNebula without giving much thought to infrastructure partitioning and provisioning. Yet, for medium and large-scale deployments you will probably want to provide some level of isolation and structure. OpenNebula offers a flexible and powerful cloud provisioning model based on Virtual Data Centers (VDCs) that enables an integrated, comprehensive framework to dynamically provision the infrastructure resources in large multi-datacenter and multi-cloud environments to different customers, business units or groups.</description>
