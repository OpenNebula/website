      <description>This chapter describes the performance capabilities of various OpenNebula components and how to deploy and configure OpenNebula on a large scale or just fine-tune the performance.&#xA;How Should I Read This Chapter Read the Scalability Testing and Tuning to understand the performance capabilities of OpenNebula and ways to improve performance by following test scenarios. Move on to the Sunstone for Large Deployment to learn how to achieve a better performance and security by running Sunstone GUI within a web server or behind HTTP(S) proxy.</description>

      <description>Determining the scalability of your cloud, and how to improve it, requires you to balance many variables. There are several aspects that can limit the scalability of a cloud, from the storage to the network Back-end, and no one solution meets everyone’s scalability goals. This guide firstly presents the scale limits of a single OpenNebula instance (single zone), and then provides some recommendations to tune your deployment for a larger scale.</description>

      <description>Low to medium size enterprise clouds will typically deploy FireEdge on a single machine with the other OpenNebula daemons as part. However, this simple deployment can be extended by&#xA;Improving scalability of the server for large user pools, usually by deploying FireEdge as a separate application on one or more hosts. This guide introduces various deployment options to achieve this. Check also the API Scalability guide for tips on how to improve FireEdge and OpenNebula Daemon performance.</description>

      <description>This guide covers advanced SSH configuration for OpenNebula nodes, specifically:&#xA;integrated OpenNebula SSH Authentication Agent SSH client configuration gathering of host SSH public keys Note This section extends the Configure Passwordless SSH step within the Node installation guides with advanced SSH configuration and usage. Authentication Agent OpenNebula’s integrated SSH Authentication Agent service is automatically started on the Front-end by implicit dependencies of OpenNebula. During startup, it imports the default SSH private keys of oneadmin user from the directory /var/lib/one/.</description>
