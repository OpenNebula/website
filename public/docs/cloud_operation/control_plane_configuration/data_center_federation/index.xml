      <description>The OpenNebula Federation is a tightly coupled integration of several instances of OpenNebula Front-end (called Zones), where each instance (Zone) shares the same user accounts, groups, and permissions configuration. You can define access policies federation-wide where users can be restricted to certain Zones, or to specific Clusters inside a Zone. Federation topology consists of one master and several slave Front-ends (any other federation configurations, e.g. deeper master-slave hierarchy, arenâ€™t supported).</description>

      <description>This section will explain how to configure two (or more) OpenNebula Zones to work as federation master and slave. The process described here can be applied to new installations or existing OpenNebula instances.&#xA;OpenNebula master Zone server replicates database changes on slaves using a federated log. The log contains the SQL commands which should be applied in all Zones.&#xA;In this document, each configuration step starts with Master or Slave to indicate the server where the step must be performed.</description>

      <description>A user will have access to all the Zones where at least one of his or her groups has VDC resources. This access be can done through Sunstone or the CLI.&#xA;Sunstone In the upper right corner of the Sunstone page, users will see a globe icon next to the name of the Zone currently being used. If the user clicks on that, he or she will get a dropdown with all the accessible Zones.</description>
